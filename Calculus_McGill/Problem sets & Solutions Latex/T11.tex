\begin{enumerate}
  \item Sketch the graphs of a continuous functions on the interval $[1,5]$ and which satisfies the following properties\\
(a) Absolute maximum at 1, absolute minimum at 3, local minimum at 2 and local maximum at 4.\\
(b) Absolute maximum at 2, absolute minimum at 5, 4 is a critical number but there is no local maximum or minimum there.
  \item Find the absolute maximum and absolute minimum values of $f$ on the given interval.\\
(a) $f(x)=x^{3}-6 x+5,[-2,5]$\\
(b) $f(x)=x+\frac{1}{x},[0.2,4]$\\
(c) $f(x)=x^{a}(1-x)^{b},[0,1]$ ( $a$ and $b$ are positive, real numbers)\\
(d) $f(t)=2 \cos t+\sin 2 t,[0, \pi / 2]$
  \item Prove that the function
\end{enumerate}

$$
f(x)=x^{101}+x^{51}+x+1
$$

has neither a local maximum or a local minimum.\\
4. Find two numbers whose difference is 10 and whose product is minimal.\\
5. Which point on the line

$$
y=2 x+1
$$

is closest to the origin?\\
6. Find the points on the ellipse $4 x^{2}+y^{2}=4$ which are farthest from the point $(0,1)$.\\
7. A cylindrical can is made from material such that the top and bottom cost twice as much as the sides. What dimensions will minimize the cost of a 4 L can?\\
8. A person is standing at coordinates $(1,4)$. They are making their way back to their house which has coordinates $(6,8)$, but first they need to pass by a river, which goes down the $x$-axis. What is the fastest path for this trip? At what $x$-coordinate should this person reach the river?
