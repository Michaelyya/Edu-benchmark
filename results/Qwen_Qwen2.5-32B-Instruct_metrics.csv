To improve, the generator should introduce a more complex narrative or context, such as varying the number of players and time in a more dynamic scenario, or incorporating additional variables like breaks or different tempos. Additionally, the problem could explore different mathematical concepts, such as ratios or proportions, to enhance the complexity and understanding level.; Clarify the relationship between the number of players and the time taken to play the symphony. Specify that the time taken is independent of the number of players.; Provide a more realistic context by explaining why the number of players does not affect the time taken, such as the symphony being a fixed-length piece.; Simplify the problem statement to reduce potential confusion, ensuring that the focus is on understanding the concept of fixed time for a performance.",0.0,50.0,70.0,70.0,70.0,90.0,75.0

1,3,There are 49 dogs signed up to compete in the dog show. There are 36 more small dogs than large dogs signed up to compete. How many small dogs are signed up to compete? ,"Let $x$ represent the number of large dogs. Since there are 36 more small dogs than large dogts, the number of small dogs is $x + 36$. The total number of dog is 49, so we set up the equation: 
\[
x + (x + 36) = 49
\]
Simplifying:
\[
2x + 36 = 49
\]
Subtracting 36 from both sides:
\[
2x = 13
\]
Dividing by 2:
\[
x = 6.5
