\section*{Problem Statement}
John takes a train that travels 80 miles per hour. His friend Mike leaves from the same location but takes a different train that goes 60 miles per hour. Mike leaves 30 minutes after John but somehow arrives 15 minutes before him. How long was John’s trip, and how far did he travel?

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{Step 1: Define Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Let \(t\) be the time (in hours) that John traveled.
    \item Since Mike arrives 15 minutes before John, his travel time is \(t - \frac{1}{4}\) hours.
    \item Mike leaves 30 minutes (or \(\frac{1}{2}\) hour) after John, so his total travel time is:
    \[
    t - \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = t - \frac{3}{4} \, \text{hours.}
    \]
    \item Let \(d\) be the distance traveled by both John and Mike.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Step 2: Set Up Equations}
We know:
\[
d = 80t \quad \text{(John's distance formula)}
\]
\[
d = 60 \left( t - \frac{3}{4} \right) \quad \text{(Mike's distance formula)}
\]

\subsection*{Step 3: Set Distances Equal}
Since both travel the same distance:
\[
80t = 60 \left( t - \frac{3}{4} \right)
\]
\[
80t = 60t - 45
\]
\[
80t - 60t = -45
\]
\[
20t = 45
\]
\[
t = \frac{45}{20} = 2.25 \, \text{hours.}
\]

\subsection*{Step 4: Calculate Distance}
Now that we know \(t = 2.25\) hours, we calculate the distance:
\[
d = 80 \times 2.25 = 180 \, \text{miles.}
\]

\subsection*{Final Answers}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{John's travel time:} \(2.25 \, \text{hours}\)
    \item \textbf{Distance traveled:} \(180 \, \text{miles}\)

Tom's initial shooting percentage is:

\section*{Problem Statement}
A car accelerates from 0 to 60 mph in 5 seconds. Calculate its acceleration in m/s². If it maintains this acceleration, how fast will it be going in 10 seconds?

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{Step 1: Convert mph to m/s}
We know:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Initial speed, \(v_i = 0 \, \text{mph}\)
    \item Final speed, \(v_f = 60 \, \text{mph}\)
\end{itemize}

To convert 60 mph to meters per second:

\[
1 \text{ mile} = 1609.34 \text{ meters, and } 1 \text{ hour} = 3600 \text{ seconds.}
\]

\[
v_f = 60 \times \frac{1609.34}{3600} \approx 26.82 \, \text{m/s.}
\]

\subsection*{Step 2: Calculate acceleration}
The formula for acceleration is:

\[
a = \frac{v_f - v_i}{t}.
\]

\[
a = \frac{26.82 - 0}{5} = 5.36 \, \text{m/s².}
\]

\subsection*{Step 3: Speed after 10 seconds}
To calculate the speed after 10 seconds if the acceleration remains constant:

\[
v = v_i + at.
\]

\[
v = 0 + 5.36 \times 10 = 53.6 \, \text{m/s.}
\]

\subsection*{Final Answers}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Acceleration:} \(5.36 \, \text{m/s²}\)

Given that the value at the end of Q3 is approximately $10,760, we need to find the percentage change from Q3 to Q4.

Let x be the percentage change in the fourth quarter.

$10,802.40 * (1 + x) = $10,760

Solving for x:

1 + x = $10,760 / $10,802.40
x = ($10,760 / $10,802.40) - 1
x ≈ -0.004

So, the percentage change in the fourth quarter is approximately -0.4%.",91.42857142857143,1.0,0.9514087342096225,0.826,"Ensure each percentage change is explicitly tied to the previous quarter's value for enhanced clarity.; Add a more engaging context, such as a specific tech startup or a personal goal for the investment, to enhance interest.",80.0,85.0,85.0,85.0,85.0,85.0,95.0
3,19,"John invested $10,000 in a tech startup called 'Innovatech' at the beginning of the year with the goal of reaching $12,000 by the end of the year. The investment grew by 12% by the end of the first quarter. In the second quarter, it decreased by 8%, and in the third quarter, it increased by 5%. By the end of the third quarter, John’s investment was worth approximately $10,760. What was the percentage change in the fourth quarter if his investment remained at $10,760 by the end of the year?","First, calculate the value of John's investment at the end of each quarter.

1. End of Q1: Initial investment * (1 + 12%) = $10,000 * 1.12 = $11,200
2. End of Q2: Value after Q1 * (1 - 8%) = $11,200 * 0.92 = $10,288
3. End of Q3: Value after Q2 * (1 + 5%) = $10,288 * 1.05 = $10,802.40

Given that the value at the end of Q3 is approximately $10,760, we need to find the percentage change from Q3 to Q4.
