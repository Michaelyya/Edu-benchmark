3,There are 49 dogs signed up to compete in the dog show. There are 36 more small dogs than large dogs signed up to compete. How many small dogs are signed up to compete? ,"In a dog show, there are 49 dogs participating. If the number of small dogs exceeds the number of large dogs by 36, how many small dogs are competing?"",
    ""solution"": ""Let \( x \) represent the number of large dogs. Since the number of small dogs is 36 more than the number of large dogs, the number of small dogs can be expressed as \( x + 36 \). The total number of dogs is 49, leading to the equation:\n\[ x + (x + 36) = 49 \\]\nSimplifying the equation gives us:\n\[ 2x + 36 = 49 \\]\nSubtracting 36 from both sides yields:\n\[ 2x = 13 \\]\nDividing both sides by 2 results in:\n\[ x = 6.5 \\]\nSince the number of dogs must be a whole number, let's re-evaluate the setup.

    ""solution"": ""First, we need to find the original dimensions of the rectangle. Let the width be \( w \) meters and the length be \( 2w \) meters. The perimeter formula for a rectangle is \( P = 2l + 2w \). Given that the perimeter is 50 meters, we set up the equation:\n\[ 2(2w) + 2w = 50 \]\[ 4w + 2w = 50 \]\[ 6w = 50 \]\[ w = \\frac{50}{6} = \\frac{25}{3} \\text{ meters} \\]\nThe length is then \( 2w = \\frac{50}{3} \\text{ meters} \\). When the width is doubled, the new width is \( 2 \\times \\frac{25}{3} = \\frac{50}{3} \\text{ meters} \\). The length remains unchanged at \( \\frac{50}{3} \\text{ meters} \\).

    ""solution"": ""Let \( r \) represent the number of red marbles and \( b \) represent the number of blue marbles. We know that \( r + b = 15 \). According to the problem, the probability of drawing a red marble is twice the probability of drawing a blue marble. This can be written as \( \\frac{r}{15} = 2 \\times \\frac{b}{15} \\). Simplifying, we get \( r = 2b \\). Substituting \( r = 2b \\) into \( r + b = 15 \\), we have \( 2b + b = 15 \\), which simplifies to \( 3b = 15 \\). Solving for \( b \\), we find \( b = 5 \\).
