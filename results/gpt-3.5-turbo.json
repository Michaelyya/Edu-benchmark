If 5 chaperones must accompany every 24 students and each person needs to pay an equal share of the transportation costs, how much should each person pay?",
          "current_solution": "The 210 students don't divide evenly into vans of 12, nor do they divide evenly with the chaperone requirements (5 chaperones per 24 students). To calculate the cost per person, we first find the number of vans needed, which is 210 students divided by 12 students per van, giving 17.5 vans. Since we can't have half a van, we need to round up to 18 vans. Then, we calculate the number of chaperones needed, which is 210 students divided by 24 students per chaperone, giving 8.75 chaperones. Again, we round up to 9 chaperones. The total cost of vans is 18 vans multiplied by $500 per van, which is $9000. The total cost of chaperones is 9 chaperones multiplied by $0, as they are accompanying the students. Therefore, the total cost is $9000. To find the cost per person, we divide the total cost by the total number of people (210 students + 9 chaperones), which is $9000 divided by 219, resulting in each person needing to pay $41.10.",

Then, we calculate the number of camp counselors needed, which is 180 students divided by 18 students per counselor, giving 10 counselors. The total cost of tents is 30 tents multiplied by $80 per tent, which is $2400. The total cost of camp counselors is 10 counselors multiplied by $0, as they are accompanying the students.
