\section*{Problem Statement}
John takes a train that travels 80 miles per hour. His friend Mike leaves from the same location but takes a different train that goes 60 miles per hour. Mike leaves 30 minutes after John but somehow arrives 15 minutes before him. How long was John’s trip, and how far did he travel?

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{Step 1: Define Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Let \(t\) be the time (in hours) that John traveled.
    \item Since Mike arrives 15 minutes before John, his travel time is \(t - \frac{1}{4}\) hours.
    \item Mike leaves 30 minutes (or \(\frac{1}{2}\) hour) after John, so his total travel time is:
    \[
    t - \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = t - \frac{3}{4} \, \text{hours.}
    \]
    \item Let \(d\) be the distance traveled by both John and Mike.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Step 2: Set Up Equations}
We know:
\[
d = 80t \quad \text{(John's distance formula)}
\]
\[
d = 60 \left( t - \frac{3}{4} \right) \quad \text{(Mike's distance formula)}
\]

\subsection*{Step 3: Set Distances Equal}
Since both travel the same distance:
\[
80t = 60 \left( t - \frac{3}{4} \right)
\]
\[
80t = 60t - 45
\]
\[
80t - 60t = -45
\]
\[
20t = 45
\]
\[
t = \frac{45}{20} = 2.25 \, \text{hours.}
\]

\subsection*{Step 4: Calculate Distance}
Now that we know \(t = 2.25\) hours, we calculate the distance:
\[
d = 80 \times 2.25 = 180 \, \text{miles.}
\]

\subsection*{Final Answers}
\begin{itemize}

    \item Let \(t\) be the time (in hours) that Alice traveled.
    \item Since Bob arrives 20 minutes before Alice, his travel time is \(t - \frac{1}{3}\) hours.
    \item Bob leaves 45 minutes (or \(\frac{3}{4}\) hour) after Alice, so his total travel time is:

\[

\[
40t = 30t - 25
\]
\[

\[

\section*{Problem Statement}
A car accelerates from 0 to 60 mph in 5 seconds. Calculate its acceleration in m/s². If it maintains this acceleration, how fast will it be going in 10 seconds?

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{Step 1: Convert mph to m/s}
We know:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Initial speed, \(v_i = 0 \, \text{mph}\)
    \item Final speed, \(v_f = 60 \, \text{mph}\)
\end{itemize}

To convert 60 mph to meters per second:

\[
1 \text{ mile} = 1609.34 \text{ meters, and } 1 \text{ hour} = 3600 \text{ seconds.}
\]

\[
v_f = 60 \times \frac{1609.34}{3600} \approx 26.82 \, \text{m/s.}
\]

\subsection*{Step 2: Calculate acceleration}
The formula for acceleration is:

\[
a = \frac{v_f - v_i}{t}.
\]

\[
a = \frac{26.82 - 0}{5} = 5.36 \, \text{m/s².}
\]

\subsection*{Step 3: Speed after 10 seconds}
To calculate the speed after 10 seconds if the acceleration remains constant:

\[
v = v_i + at.
\]

\[
v = 0 + 5.36 \times 10 = 53.6 \, \text{m/s.}
\]

\subsection*{Final Answers}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Acceleration:} \(5.36 \, \text{m/s²}\)
    \item \textbf{Speed after 10 seconds:} \(53.6 \, \text{m/s}\), which is approximately \(120 \, \text{mph.}\)

How long does it take for the second car to catch up to the first car?,"Let t be the time taken for the second car to catch up to the first car. The distance the first car travels in t hours is 70t km. The distance the second car travels in t hours is 90(t-2) km (as it started 2 hours later). Since both cars travel the same distance when the second car catches up, we have the equation 70t = 90(t-2). Solving this equation gives t = 6. Therefore, it takes 6 hours for the second car to catch up to the first car.",92.14285714285714,1.0,0.9196031103347022,0.827,"Specify that both cars are traveling on a straight path to enhance clarity.; Use a more engaging context, such as a car rally, to increase interest.",70.0,85.0,85.0,85.0,85.0,85.0,95.0

1,62,"If a car travels at a speed of 60 km/h and the journey takes 2 hours, how far does it travel if it stops midway for an indefinite period?","The question is flawed due to the inclusion of the phrase 'stops midway for an indefinite period,' which adds ambiguity. The time it takes for the journey should straightforwardly determine the distance using the formula distance = speed × time, which would be 120 km for a 2-hour nonstop trip. However, the mention of stopping introduces unnecessary complexity without any information on how the stop affects the total travel time or if the travel resumes, thus making it impossible to determine the actual distance traveled with the given data. The scenario assumes that the stop does not impact the overall travel time, which is unrealistic or at least unexplained.",71.42857142857143,1.0,0.8658152759580846,0.443,"Remove or clarify the phrase 'stops midway for an indefinite period' to eliminate ambiguity.; Specify how the stop affects the journey, or remove it to maintain a straightforward calculation.; Consider a more realistic scenario where the car travels to a specific destination without unnecessary stops.",70.0,50.0,50.0,50.0,50.0,50.0,60.0
2,62,"If a train travels at a speed of 80 km/h and the journey takes 3 hours, how far does it travel if it stops for a 30-minute break and then continues at the same speed?","The distance traveled by the train can be calculated by first determining the distance covered before the stop and then after the stop. Before the stop, the train travels at a speed of 80 km/h for 2.5 hours (3 hours - 0.5 hours break time), covering a distance of 200 km (80 km/h * 2.5 h). After the stop, the train continues at the same speed for the remaining 0.5 hours, covering an additional 40 km (80 km/h * 0.5 h).

Before the stop, the car travels at a speed of 60 km/h for 3.67 hours (4 hours - 0.33 hours break time), covering a distance of 220.2 km (60 km/h * 3.67 h).
