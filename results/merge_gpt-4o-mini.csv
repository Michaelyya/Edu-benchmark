\section*{Problem Statement}
John takes a train that travels 80 miles per hour. His friend Mike leaves from the same location but takes a different train that goes 60 miles per hour. Mike leaves 30 minutes after John but somehow arrives 15 minutes before him. How long was John’s trip, and how far did he travel?

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{Step 1: Define Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Let \(t\) be the time (in hours) that John traveled.
    \item Since Mike arrives 15 minutes before John, his travel time is \(t - \frac{1}{4}\) hours.
    \item Mike leaves 30 minutes (or \(\frac{1}{2}\) hour) after John, so his total travel time is:
    \[
    t - \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = t - \frac{3}{4} \, \text{hours.}
    \]
    \item Let \(d\) be the distance traveled by both John and Mike.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Step 2: Set Up Equations}
We know:
\[
d = 80t \quad \text{(John's distance formula)}
\]
\[
d = 60 \left( t - \frac{3}{4} \right) \quad \text{(Mike's distance formula)}
\]

\subsection*{Step 3: Set Distances Equal}
Since both travel the same distance:
\[
80t = 60 \left( t - \frac{3}{4} \right)
\]
\[
80t = 60t - 45
\]
\[
80t - 60t = -45
\]
\[
20t = 45
\]
\[
t = \frac{45}{20} = 2.25 \, \text{hours.}
\]

\subsection*{Step 4: Calculate Distance}
Now that we know \(t = 2.25\) hours, we calculate the distance:
\[
d = 80 \times 2.25 = 180 \, \text{miles.}
\]

\subsection*{Final Answers}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{John's travel time:} \(2.25 \, \text{hours}\)
    \item \textbf{Distance traveled:} \(180 \, \text{miles}\)

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{Step 1: Define Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Let \(t\) be the time (in hours) that Emily traveled.
    \item Since Alex arrives 10 minutes before Emily, his travel time is \(t - \frac{1}{6}\) hours.
    \item Alex leaves 20 minutes (or \(\frac{1}{3}\) hour) after Emily, so his total travel time is:
    \[
    t - \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{6} = t - \frac{1}{2} \, \text{hours.}
    \]
    \item Let \(d\) be the distance traveled by both Emily and Alex.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Step 2: Set Up Equations}
We know:
\[
d = 15t \quad \text{(Emily's distance formula)}
\]
\[
d = 10 \left( t - \frac{1}{2} \right) \quad \text{(Alex's distance formula)}
\]

\subsection*{Step 3: Set Distances Equal}
Since both travel the same distance:
\[
15t = 10 \left( t - \frac{1}{2} \right)
\]
\[
15t = 10t - 5
\]
\[
15t - 10t = -5
\]
\[
5t = 5
\]
\[
t = 1 \, \text{hour.}
\]

\subsection*{Step 4: Calculate Distance}
Now that we know \(t = 1\) hour, we calculate the distance:
\[
d = 15 \times 1 = 15 \, \text{miles.}
\]

\section*{Problem Statement}
A car accelerates from 0 to 60 mph in 5 seconds. Calculate its acceleration in m/s². If it maintains this acceleration, how fast will it be going in 10 seconds?

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{Step 1: Convert mph to m/s}
We know:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Initial speed, \(v_i = 0 \, \text{mph}\)
    \item Final speed, \(v_f = 60 \, \text{mph}\)
\end{itemize}

To convert 60 mph to meters per second:

\[
1 \text{ mile} = 1609.34 \text{ meters, and } 1 \text{ hour} = 3600 \text{ seconds.}
\]

\[
v_f = 60 \times \frac{1609.34}{3600} \approx 26.82 \, \text{m/s.}
\]

\subsection*{Step 2: Calculate acceleration}
The formula for acceleration is:

\[
a = \frac{v_f - v_i}{t}.
\]

\[
a = \frac{26.82 - 0}{5} = 5.36 \, \text{m/s².}
\]

\subsection*{Step 3: Speed after 10 seconds}
To calculate the speed after 10 seconds if the acceleration remains constant:

\[
v = v_i + at.
\]

\[
v = 0 + 5.36 \times 10 = 53.6 \, \text{m/s.}
\]

\subsection*{Final Answers}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Acceleration:} \(5.36 \, \text{m/s²}\)
    \item \textbf{Speed after 10 seconds:} \(53.6 \, \text{m/s}\), which is approximately \(120 \, \text{mph.}\)

\section*{Problem Statement}
A bicycle accelerates from 0 to 30 mph in 4 seconds. Calculate its acceleration in m/s². If it maintains this acceleration, how fast will it be going in 8 seconds?

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{Step 1: Convert mph to m/s}
We know:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Initial speed, \(v_i = 0 \, \text{mph}\)
    \item Final speed, \(v_f = 30 \, \text{mph}\)
\end{itemize}

To convert 30 mph to meters per second:

\[
1 \text{ mile} = 1609.34 \text{ meters, and } 1 \text{ hour} = 3600 \text{ seconds.}
\]

\[
v_f = 30 \times \frac{1609.34}{3600} \approx 13.41 \, \text{m/s.}
\]

\subsection*{Step 2: Calculate acceleration}
The formula for acceleration is:

\[
a = \frac{v_f - v_i}{t}.
\]

\[
a = \frac{13.41 - 0}{4} = 3.35 \, \text{m/s².}
\]

\subsection*{Step 3: Speed after 8 seconds}
To calculate the speed after 8 seconds if the acceleration remains constant:

\[
v = v_i + at.
\]

\[
v = 0 + 3.35 \times 8 = 26.8 \, \text{m/s.}
\]

\subsection*{Final Answers}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Acceleration:} \(3.35 \, \text{m/s²}\)

\section*{Problem Statement}
A car accelerates from 0 to 50 mph in 5 seconds. Calculate its acceleration in m/s². If it maintains this acceleration, how fast will it be going in 10 seconds?

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{Step 1: Convert mph to m/s}
We know:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Initial speed, \(v_i = 0 \, \text{mph}\)
    \item Final speed, \(v_f = 50 \, \text{mph}\)
\end{itemize}

To convert 50 mph to meters per second:

\[
1 \text{ mile} = 1609.34 \text{ meters, and } 1 \text{ hour} = 3600 \text{ seconds.}
\]

\[
v_f = 50 \times \frac{1609.34}{3600} \approx 22.35 \, \text{m/s.}
\]

\subsection*{Step 2: Calculate acceleration}
The formula for acceleration is:

\[
a = \frac{v_f - v_i}{t}.
\]

\[
a = \frac{22.35 - 0}{5} = 4.47 \, \text{m/s².}
\]

\subsection*{Step 3: Speed after 10 seconds}
To calculate the speed after 10 seconds if the acceleration remains constant:

\[
v = v_i + at.
\]

\[
v = 0 + 4.47 \times 10 = 44.7 \, \text{m/s.}
\]

\subsection*{Final Answers}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Acceleration:} \(4.47 \, \text{m/s²}\)
    \item \textbf{Speed after 10 seconds:} \(44.7 \, \text{m/s}\), which is approximately \(100 \, \text{mph.}\)

\text{Then, Tom rides for } t - \frac{1}{3} \text{ hours (since 20 minutes is } \frac{1}{3} \text{ of an hour).} \\
\text{Since Tom finishes 10 minutes (or } \frac{1}{6} \text{ hours) before Sarah, we have:} \\
t - \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{6} = t - \frac{1}{2} \\

The second bus travels at 40 miles per hour, so in 3 hours, it travels: 40 miles/hour * 3 hours = 120 miles. Since both buses are traveling towards each other, the total distance between the two cities is the sum of the distances traveled by both buses: 180 miles + 120 miles = 300 miles.

If the original perimeter of the garden is 60 units and the perimeter is decreased by 10 units, what is the new width of the garden?","Let the length of the garden be denoted as L. Then, the width W can be expressed as W = 4L. The perimeter P of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(L + W). Substituting the expression for W, we have P = 2(L + 4L) = 2(5L) = 10L. Given that the original perimeter is 60 units, we set up the equation: 10L = 60. Solving for L gives L = 6 units. Now, substituting L back into the width equation, we find W = 4L = 4(6) = 24 units.

If the original perimeter of the playground is 48 units and the perimeter is increased by 12 units, what is the new width of the playground?","Let the length of the playground be denoted as L. Then, the width W can be expressed as W = 3L. The perimeter P of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(L + W). Substituting the expression for W, we have P = 2(L + 3L) = 2(4L) = 8L.

If the length of the patch is 5 meters longer than its width, what is the area of the vegetable patch?","To solve this problem, we start with the perimeter formula for a rectangle, which is given by $P = 2(l + w)$. Here, we know the perimeter $P = 60$ meters. We can express the length $l$ in terms of the width $w$ as $l = w + 5$. Substituting this into the perimeter formula gives us: $2((w + 5) + w) = 60$. Simplifying this, we have $2(2w + 5) = 60$, which leads to $4w + 10 = 60$. Subtracting 10 from both sides gives $4w = 50$, and dividing by 4 results in $w = 12.5$ meters. Now, substituting back to find the length, we have $l = 12.5 + 5 = 17.5$ meters.

291,3,100,"Two trains are on a mission to deliver supplies to their respective towns. Train A departs from Town X at 1:30 PM, traveling towards Town Y at a speed of 50 miles per hour. Train B, however, leaves Town Y for Town X at 1:30 PM as well, but it encounters a delay and starts its journey 15 minutes later, traveling at 70 miles per hour. If the distance between Town X and Town Y is 150 miles, how long will it take for the two trains to meet after Train B starts its journey?","First, we need to calculate the distance Train A covers before Train B starts. Train A travels for 15 minutes (or 0.25 hours) at 50 miles per hour. The distance covered by Train A in that time is: distance = speed × time = 50 miles/hour × 0.25 hours = 12.5 miles. Therefore, when Train B starts, the remaining distance between the two trains is 150 miles - 12.5 miles = 137.5 miles. Now, we can find the combined speed of both trains. Train A continues at 50 miles per hour, and Train B travels at 70 miles per hour, giving a combined speed of 50 + 70 = 120 miles per hour. To find the time it takes for them to meet after Train B starts, we use the formula: time = distance / speed. Thus, time = 137.5 miles / 120 miles per hour = 1.1458 hours, which is approximately 1 hour and 9 minutes.

339,2,117,A cyclist rides from Town X to Town Y. He covers the first half of the distance at 24 km/h and the second half at 36 km/h. Calculate the average speed of the cyclist for the entire trip.,"To find the average speed, we need to use the formula: Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time. Let the total distance be D. The first half is D/2, and the second half is also D/2. The time taken for the first half is (D/2) / 24 hours, and for the second half, it is (D/2) / 36 hours. Therefore, the total time T = (D/2) / 24 + (D/2) / 36. To combine these, we find a common denominator, which is 72. Thus, T = (3D/72) + (2D/72) = (5D/72) hours. Now, substituting back into the average speed formula gives us: Average Speed = D / (5D/72) = 72/5 = 14.4 km/h.

340,3,117,A runner participates in a marathon that consists of two segments. He completes the first segment of 10 km at a speed of 8 km/h and the second segment of 15 km at a speed of 12 km/h. Calculate the average speed of the runner for the entire marathon.,"To find the average speed, we use the formula: Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time. Let the total distance be D. The first segment is 10 km, and the second segment is 15 km, making the total distance D = 10 + 15 = 25 km. The time taken for the first segment is 10 km / 8 km/h = 1.25 hours, and for the second segment, it is 15 km / 12 km/h = 1.25 hours. Therefore, the total time T = 1.25 + 1.25 = 2.5 hours. Now, substituting back into the average speed formula gives us: Average Speed = 25 km / 2.5 hours = 10 km/h.
