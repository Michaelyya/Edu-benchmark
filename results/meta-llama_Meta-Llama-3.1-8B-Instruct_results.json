Since one family has an extra child, we add 1 to the total number of children, making it 15 + 1 = 16 children. The total number of people equals 10 + 16 = 26. Since each family brings one picnic basket for every four people, we divide the total number of people by 4: 26 / 4 = 6.5. However, since we cannot have half a picnic basket, we round down to 6.5 and since we can't bring half a basket, we take the floor of 6.5 which is 6.

          "current_solution": "Let the score of the third test be x. The average score of the last two tests is (x + 91) / 2 = 89. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get x + 91 = 178. Subtracting 91 from both sides, we get x = 87. Alternatively, the average score of all three tests is (72 + 91 + x) / 3 = 84. Multiplying both sides by 3, we get 72 + 91 + x = 252. Simplifying, we get 163 + x = 252. Subtracting 163 from both sides, we get x = 89. Both methods give the same result.",

      "current_question": "The annual Harvest Festival is approaching, and Sarah wants to win first prize for her apples. She starts with 23 apples in her orchard. On the first day, she picks 17 more apples and gives 5 to her neighbor. On the second day, she picks 34 apples, but 12 of them are rotten. If each non-rotten apple weighs approximately 0.25 pounds, and Sarah needs to meet a minimum weight requirement of 15 pounds to qualify for the festival, approximately how many pounds of non-rotten apples does Sarah have to sell at the market to meet the target?",
      "current_solution": "First, Sarah has 23 + 17 - 5 = 35 apples. Then, she picks 34 more apples, but 12 of them are rotten. So, she has 35 + 34 - 12 = 57 non-rotten apples. Since each non-rotten apple weighs 0.25 pounds, Sarah has 57 * 0.25 = 14.25 pounds of non-rotten apples to sell at the market. To meet the festival's minimum weight requirement of 15 pounds, Sarah would need 15 / 0.25 = 60 non-rotten apples, but she only has 57, so she falls short by 3 apples. However, if Sarah wants to meet the minimum weight requirement, she would need to pick 3 more non-rotten apples to reach 60 apples, which would weigh 60 * 0.25 = 15 pounds.",

This year, it decreased by 8% in the first quarter, based on the balance after last year's growth. In the second quarter, it increased by 5% based on the balance after the first quarter's decrease. Let x be the percentage decrease in the third quarter based on the balance after the second quarter's increase. If John now has approximately $10,760, what is the value of x?",
      "current_solution": "Let's break down the problem into smaller steps. First, we calculate the balance after last year's growth: $10,000 * 1.12 = $11,200. Then, we calculate the balance after the first quarter's decrease: $11,200 * 0.92 = $10,336. Next, we calculate the balance after the second quarter's increase: $10,336 * 1.05 = $10,853.06. Now, we can set up the equation to find the balance after the third quarter's decrease: $10,853.06 * (1 - x/100) = $10,760. Solving for x, we get x = (1 - 10,760 / 10,853.06) * 100 \u2248 1.2%.
