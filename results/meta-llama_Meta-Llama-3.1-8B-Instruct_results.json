Since one family has an extra child, we add 1 to the total number of children, making it 15 + 1 = 16 children. The total number of people equals 10 + 16 = 26. Since each family brings one picnic basket for every four people, we divide the total number of people by 4: 26 / 4 = 6.5. However, since we cannot have half a picnic basket, we round down to 6.5 and since we can't bring half a basket, we take the floor of 6.5 which is 6.

          "current_solution": "Let the score of the third test be x. The average score of the last two tests is (x + 91) / 2 = 89. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get x + 91 = 178. Subtracting 91 from both sides, we get x = 87. Alternatively, the average score of all three tests is (72 + 91 + x) / 3 = 84. Multiplying both sides by 3, we get 72 + 91 + x = 252. Simplifying, we get 163 + x = 252. Subtracting 163 from both sides, we get x = 89. Both methods give the same result.",

After the stop, Alex will have to cover the remaining distance of 360 - 90 - 37.5 = 232.5 miles at a reduced speed of 45 miles per hour. We can find the time it takes for Alex to cover this distance by dividing the remaining distance by Alex's speed: 232.5 miles / 45 miles per hour = 5.17 hours.

Since the train was originally supposed to arrive at 9:00 AM, the actual travel time is 1.5 hours (from 8:00 AM to 9:30 AM). However, we need to subtract the 30-minute delay from the total time to get the actual travel time. Therefore, the actual travel time is 1.5 hours - 0.5 hours = 1 hour.

          "current_solution": "Let's denote the original speed of the train as's' and the original time taken as 't'. The original distance between City A and City B is 240 kilometers. We can use the formula: distance = speed * time. So, we have 240 = s * t. If the speed of the train is doubled, the new speed is 2s and the time taken is reduced by half, so the new time is t/2. The new distance is still 240 kilometers. We can use the formula again: 240 = 2s * (t/2). Simplifying the equation, we get 240 = s * t. This means the original equation and the new equation are the same. To find the original speed's', we need more information. However, if we assume the train's speed and time are related by the equation s = k / t (where k is a constant), then we can find 'k' by using the fact that 240 = k / t. Then, s = 240t / t = 240. But without the value of 't', we still cannot find the speed of the train. Alternatively, we can assume a specific relationship between the speed and time, such as s = 60 / t. Then, we can use the fact that 240 = s * t to find the value of 't' and then find's'. Let's assume s = 60 / t. Then, 240 = (60 / t) * t, which gives us 240 = 60. This is not possible, so our assumption is incorrect. However, if we assume s = 240 / t, then 240 = (240 / t) * t, which gives us 240 = 240. This is still not possible, so we need to re-examine the problem. The correct assumption is s = k / t, where k is a constant. Then, 240 = (k / t) * t, which gives us 240 = k. So, s = k / t = 240 / t. However, we still cannot find the speed of the train without the value of 't'. If we are given the original time 't', we can find the speed's' by using the formula s = 240 / t.",

Alex, however, decides to take his mountain bike, which has a top speed of 18 miles per hour. They start their ride at the same point, but Alex gets a 45-minute head start. Despite this, Tom arrives 20 minutes before Alex. If the distance to their destination is the same, how long did Tom's trip take, and how far did he travel?",
      "current_solution": "Let's denote Tom's travel time as $t$ hours and the distance as $d$. Since the distance is the same for both Tom and Alex, we can set up the equation $25t = 18(t + 0.75)$, where 0.75 hours is the time difference between their departures. Solving for $t$, we get $t = 1.5$ hours. Therefore, Tom's trip lasted for 1.5 hours, and since he traveled at 25 miles per hour, the distance he covered is 37.5 miles.",

      "current_solution": "Let's denote the sum of the original five students' scores as S. The average score of the original five students is 80, so S/5 = 80. Therefore, S = 400. After one student's score is removed, the sum of the remaining four students' scores is S - x, where x is the removed student's score. The average of the remaining four students is 82, so (S - x)/4 = 82. Substituting S = 400, we get (400 - x)/4 = 82. Multiply both sides by 4 to get 400 - x = 328.

      "current_solution": "Let's denote John's current age as J and Mary's current age as M. From the given information, we have J = 2M. In five years, Mary's age will be M + 5, and John's age three years ago was J - 3. According to the problem, M + 5 = J - 3. Substituting J = 2M into this equation, we get M + 5 = 2M - 3. Simplifying, we get M = 8. Substituting M = 8 into J = 2M, we get J = 16. Therefore, John is 16 years old, and Mary is 8 years old now.",

We also know that the length is twice as much as the width, so L = 2W. Substituting L = 2W into the equation 2L + 2W = 24, we get 2(2W) + 2W = 24, which simplifies to 6W = 24. Dividing both sides by 6, we find that W = 4. Since L = 2W, the length is L = 2 * 4 = 8. The area of a rectangle is given by A = L * W, so the area is A = 8 * 4 = 32 square cm.",

      "current_solution": "Let's denote the original speed of the train as's' and the original time taken as 't'. The original distance between City A and City B is 240 kilometers. We can use the formula: distance = speed * time. So, we have 240 = s * t. If the speed of the train is doubled, the new speed is 2s and the time taken is reduced by half, so the new time is t/2. The new distance is still 240 kilometers. We can use the formula again: 240 = 2s * (t/2). Simplifying the equation, we get 240 = s * t. This means the original equation and the new equation are the same. To find the original speed's', we need more information. However, if we assume the train's speed and time are related by the equation s = k / t (where k is a constant), then we can find 'k' by using the fact that 240 = k / t. Then, s = 240t / t = 240. But without the value of 't', we still cannot find the speed of the train. Alternatively, we can assume a specific relationship between the speed and time, such as s = 60 / t. Then, we can use the fact that 240 = s * t to find the value of 't' and then find's'. Let's assume s = 60 / t. Then, 240 = (60 / t) * t, which gives us 240 = 60. This is not possible, so our assumption is incorrect. However, if we assume s = 240 / t, then 240 = (240 / t) * t, which gives us 240 = 240. This is still not possible, so we need to re-examine the problem. The correct assumption is s = k / t, where k is a constant. Then, 240 = (k / t) * t, which gives us 240 = k. So, s = k / t = 240 / t. However, we still cannot find the speed of the train without the value of 't'. If we are given the original time 't', we can find the speed's' by using the formula s = 240 / t.",

      "current_solution": "To find the time when the trains meet, first, we need to calculate their combined speed, which is 60 mph + 50 mph = 110 mph. The distance between the two stations is 150 miles. Using the formula time = distance / speed, we can find the time it takes for the two trains to meet. time = 150 miles / 110 mph = 1.36 hours. Since they started at 8:00 AM, we need to convert the time to hours and minutes. 1 hour = 60 minutes, so 0.36 hours is 21.6 minutes.
