\section*{Problem Statement}
John takes a train that travels 80 miles per hour. His friend Mike leaves from the same location but takes a different train that goes 60 miles per hour. Mike leaves 30 minutes after John but somehow arrives 15 minutes before him. How long was John’s trip, and how far did he travel?

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{Step 1: Define Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Let \(t\) be the time (in hours) that John traveled.
    \item Since Mike arrives 15 minutes before John, his travel time is \(t - \frac{1}{4}\) hours.
    \item Mike leaves 30 minutes (or \(\frac{1}{2}\) hour) after John, so his total travel time is:
    \[
    t - \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = t - \frac{3}{4} \, \text{hours.}
    \]
    \item Let \(d\) be the distance traveled by both John and Mike.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Step 2: Set Up Equations}
We know:
\[
d = 80t \quad \text{(John's distance formula)}
\]
\[
d = 60 \left( t - \frac{3}{4} \right) \quad \text{(Mike's distance formula)}
\]

\subsection*{Step 3: Set Distances Equal}
Since both travel the same distance:
\[
80t = 60 \left( t - \frac{3}{4} \right)
\]
\[
80t = 60t - 45
\]
\[
80t - 60t = -45
\]
\[
20t = 45
\]
\[
t = \frac{45}{20} = 2.25 \, \text{hours.}
\]

\subsection*{Step 4: Calculate Distance}
Now that we know \(t = 2.25\) hours, we calculate the distance:
\[
d = 80 \times 2.25 = 180 \, \text{miles.}
\]

\subsection*{Final Answers}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{John's travel time:} \(2.25 \, \text{hours}\)
    \item \textbf{Distance traveled:} \(180 \, \text{miles}\)

\subsection*{Step 1: Initial Success Rate}
Tom's initial shooting percentage is:

\[

\[

\section*{Problem Statement}
A car accelerates from 0 to 60 mph in 5 seconds. Calculate its acceleration in m/s². If it maintains this acceleration, how fast will it be going in 10 seconds?

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{Step 1: Convert mph to m/s}
We know:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Initial speed, \(v_i = 0 \, \text{mph}\)
    \item Final speed, \(v_f = 60 \, \text{mph}\)
\end{itemize}

To convert 60 mph to meters per second:

\[
1 \text{ mile} = 1609.34 \text{ meters, and } 1 \text{ hour} = 3600 \text{ seconds.}
\]

\[
v_f = 60 \times \frac{1609.34}{3600} \approx 26.82 \, \text{m/s.}
\]

\subsection*{Step 2: Calculate acceleration}
The formula for acceleration is:

\[
a = \frac{v_f - v_i}{t}.
\]

\[
a = \frac{26.82 - 0}{5} = 5.36 \, \text{m/s².}
\]

\subsection*{Step 3: Speed after 10 seconds}
To calculate the speed after 10 seconds if the acceleration remains constant:

\[
v = v_i + at.
\]

\[
v = 0 + 5.36 \times 10 = 53.6 \, \text{m/s.}
\]

\subsection*{Final Answers}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Acceleration:} \(5.36 \, \text{m/s²}\)
    \item \textbf{Speed after 10 seconds:} \(53.6 \, \text{m/s}\), which is approximately \(120 \, \text{mph.}\)
