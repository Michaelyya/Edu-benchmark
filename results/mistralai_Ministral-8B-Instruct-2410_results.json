Let's denote the age difference between Rose and Mark as D. When Rose was as old as Mark is now (20), Mark was D years younger. So, Rose's age at that time was R - D. According to the problem, Rose is currently twice as old as Mark was at that time. Therefore, we can set up the equation: R = 2 * (R - D). Since Mark is 20 now, we know that D = 20. Plugging this into the equation, we get: R = 2 * (R - 20). Solving for R, we get: R = 40. Therefore, Rose is currently 40 years old.",

If 3 teachers must accompany every 35 students and each person needs to pay an equal share of the transportation costs, how much should each person pay if 203 students are attending?",
      "current_solution": "The 203 students can be divided into 3 buses (67 students per bus) and 2 teachers (one for each bus), making a total of 70 people. The total cost is 3 buses x $550 = $1650. Therefore, each person should pay $1650 / 70 = $23.57.",

        "To improve the problem, the generator should introduce variations in the narrative or the values used in the problem. For example, change the number of students, the cost of the buses, or the ratio of teachers to students. Additionally, the problem could incorporate a different real-life scenario, such as planning a community event or organizing a sports team trip, to demonstrate a broader understanding of the context and application of the math concepts."
