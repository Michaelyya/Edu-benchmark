\section*{Problem Statement}
John takes a train that travels 80 miles per hour. His friend Mike leaves from the same location but takes a different train that goes 60 miles per hour. Mike leaves 30 minutes after John but somehow arrives 15 minutes before him. How long was John’s trip, and how far did he travel?

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{Step 1: Define Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Let \(t\) be the time (in hours) that John traveled.
    \item Since Mike arrives 15 minutes before John, his travel time is \(t - \frac{1}{4}\) hours.
    \item Mike leaves 30 minutes (or \(\frac{1}{2}\) hour) after John, so his total travel time is:
    \[
    t - \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = t - \frac{3}{4} \, \text{hours.}
    \]
    \item Let \(d\) be the distance traveled by both John and Mike.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Step 2: Set Up Equations}
We know:
\[
d = 80t \quad \text{(John's distance formula)}
\]
\[
d = 60 \left( t - \frac{3}{4} \right) \quad \text{(Mike's distance formula)}
\]

\subsection*{Step 3: Set Distances Equal}
Since both travel the same distance:
\[
80t = 60 \left( t - \frac{3}{4} \right)
\]
\[
80t = 60t - 45
\]
\[
80t - 60t = -45
\]
\[
20t = 45
\]
\[
t = \frac{45}{20} = 2.25 \, \text{hours.}
\]

\subsection*{Step 4: Calculate Distance}
Now that we know \(t = 2.25\) hours, we calculate the distance:
\[
d = 80 \times 2.25 = 180 \, \text{miles.}
\]

\subsection*{Final Answers}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{John's travel time:} \(2.25 \, \text{hours}\)
    \item \textbf{Distance traveled:} \(180 \, \text{miles}\)

    \item Initial speed, \(v_i = 0 \, \text{mph}\)
    \item Final speed, \(v_f = 60 \, \text{mph}\)
\end{itemize}

To convert 60 mph to meters per second:

\[
1 \text{ mile} = 1609.34 \text{ meters, and } 1 \text{ hour} = 3600 \text{ seconds.}
\]

\[
v_f = 60 \times \frac{1609.34}{3600} \approx 26.82 \, \text{m/s.}
\]

\subsection*{Step 2: Calculate acceleration}
The formula for acceleration is:

\[
a = \frac{v_f - v_i}{t}.
\]

\[
a = \frac{26.82 - 0}{5} = 5.36 \, \text{m/s².}
\]

\subsection*{Step 3: Speed after 10 seconds}
To calculate the speed after 10 seconds if the acceleration remains constant:

\[
v = v_i + at.
\]

\[
v = 0 + 5.36 \times 10 = 53.6 \, \text{m/s.}

\section*{Problem Statement}
A car accelerates from 0 to 60 mph in 5 seconds. Calculate its acceleration in m/s². If it maintains this acceleration, how fast will it be going in 10 seconds?

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{Step 1: Convert mph to m/s}
We know:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Initial speed, \(v_i = 0 \, \text{mph}\)
    \item Final speed, \(v_f = 60 \, \text{mph}\)
\end{itemize}

To convert 60 mph to meters per second:

\[v_f = 60 \times \frac{1609.34}{3600} \approx 26.82 \, \text{m/s.}\]

\subsection*{Step 2: Calculate acceleration}

\[a = \frac{v_f - v_i}{t}.\]
\[a = \frac{26.82 - 0}{5} = 5.36 \, \text{m/s².}\]

2,39,"A train travels from City A to City B. If the speed of the train is doubled, the time taken is reduced by half. What is the speed of the train, given that the distance between City A and City B is 240 kilometers?","Let's denote the original speed of the train as's' and the original time taken as 't'. The original distance between City A and City B is 240 kilometers. We can use the formula: distance = speed * time. So, we have 240 = s * t. If the speed of the train is doubled, the new speed is 2s and the time taken is reduced by half, so the new time is t/2. The new distance is still 240 kilometers. We can use the formula again: 240 = 2s * (t/2). Simplifying the equation, we get 240 = s * t. This means the original equation and the new equation are the same. To find the original speed's', we need more information. However, if we assume the train's speed and time are related by the equation s = k / t (where k is a constant), then we can find 'k' by using the fact that 240 = k / t. Then, s = 240t / t = 240. But without the value of 't', we still cannot find the speed of the train. Alternatively, we can assume a specific relationship between the speed and time, such as s = 60 / t. Then, we can use the fact that 240 = s * t to find the value of 't' and then find's'. Let's assume s = 60 / t. Then, 240 = (60 / t) * t, which gives us 240 = 60. This is not possible, so our assumption is incorrect. However, if we assume s = 240 / t, then 240 = (240 / t) * t, which gives us 240 = 240. This is still not possible, so we need to re-examine the problem. The correct assumption is s = k / t, where k is a constant. Then, 240 = (k / t) * t, which gives us 240 = k. So, s = k / t = 240 / t. However, we still cannot find the speed of the train without the value of 't'.
