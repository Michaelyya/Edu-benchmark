What strategy can they use to ensure this happens?\",\n    \"solution\": \"The players can use the following strategy: Assign a binary value (0 for white and 1 for black) to each hat color. Let the infinite sequence of hat colors seen by each person (excluding their own) be represented as an infinite binary sequence. Each person can then calculate the parity (even or odd number of 1s) of the binary sequence they see. If the parity is even, they assume their own hat is white (0); if the parity is odd, they assume their own hat is black (1). This ensures that only one person's guess will be wrong because the sum of an infinite series modulo 2 is well-defined, and the person who guesses incorrectly is the one whose hat color changes the parity of the observed sequence.",
