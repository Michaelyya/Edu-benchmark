If the distance between City A and City B is 200 km, at what point do the trains meet, assuming that City A and City B are 100 km apart?",
          "current_solution": "The question is flawed due to contradictory information regarding the distance between City A and City B. Initially, it's stated as 200 km, but later it says they are 100 km apart. This contradiction makes it impossible to determine the correct point where the trains meet without additional clarification. Furthermore, it does not specify whether the 'point' is a distance from City A, City B, or some reference point. The problem needs a consistent distance and a clear definition of what the 'point' refers to.",
