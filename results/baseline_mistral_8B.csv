  ""solution"": ""Let \( x \) represent the number of chairs and \( y \) represent the number of tables produced. The total cost equation can be written as: \( 20x + 50y = 5000 \).

  ""solution"": ""Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. Sarah starts with 23 apples.
2. She picks 17 more, so she has 23 + 17 = 40 apples.

110,"If a train travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 mph and reaches City B in 4 hours, how long would it take another train traveling from City B to City A at 70 mph to complete the journey considering there's a hill midway?","A train travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 mph and takes 4 hours to reach City B. If there is a hill midway that causes the train to slow down to 50 mph for a distance of 15 miles, and the rest of the journey remains at 60 mph, how long would it take another train traveling from City B to City A at 70 mph to complete the journey?"",
    ""solution"": ""First, calculate the distance between City A and City B using the initial train's speed and time: \( \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 240 \text{ miles} \). The hill covers 15 miles at 50 mph, so the time taken to traverse the hill is \( \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{50 \text{ mph}} = 0.3 \text{ hours} \). The remaining distance to be covered at 70 mph is \( 240 \text{ miles} - 15 \text{ miles} = 225 \text{ miles} \). The time taken for this part of the journey is \( \frac{225 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} \approx 3.214 \text{ hours} \). Therefore, the total time for the round trip, including the hill, is \( 0.3 \text{ hours} + 3.214 \text{ hours} = 3.514 \text{ hours} \).",0.826,70.0,85.0,85.0,85.0,85.0,85.0,95.0,91.42857142857143,1.0,0.9196031103347022

Train B travels from City C to City D, covering the same distance of 180 km. The speed of Train A is twice that of Train B. Determine the time it takes for Train B to travel from City C to City D."",
  ""solution"": ""Let's denote the speed of Train B as \( v \) km/h. Therefore, the speed of Train A is \( 2v \) km/h. Since Train A covers 180 km in 3 hours, we can set up the equation \( 2v \times 3 = 180 \) to find the speed of Train B. Solving for \( v \), we get \( v = 30 \) km/h. Now, to find the time it takes for Train B to travel 180 km, we use the formula \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \).

When do the trains meet?,"Two trains are traveling towards each other on the same track. Train A leaves Station A at a constant speed of 60 mph and takes 3 hours to travel 180 miles. Train B leaves Station B at a different time, traveling towards Station A at a constant speed of 90 mph. When do the trains meet?"",
    ""solution"": ""First, calculate the speed of Train A. Since Train A travels 180 miles in 3 hours, its speed is \( \frac{180 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ mph} \). The two trains are moving towards each other, so their relative speed is \( 60 \text{ mph} + 90 \text{ mph} = 150 \text{ mph} \). Let \( t \) be the time in hours after Train A's departure when the trains meet. The distance covered by Train A in \( t \) hours is \( 60t \) miles, and the distance covered by Train B in \( t \) hours is \( 90t \) miles. Since they meet at this point, the sum of the distances they cover is equal to the distance between the stations, which is 180 miles. Therefore, we have the equation: \( 60t + 90t = 180 \). Solving for \( t \), we get \( 150t = 180 \), so \( t = \frac{180}{150} = 1.2 \) hours.
