If everyone pays an equal share of the total transportation costs, including both students and teachers, how much should each person pay?",
      "current_solution": "First, calculate the number of buses needed: 203 students / 52 students per bus = 3.904 \u2248 4 buses. Total cost for buses: 4 buses * $550/bus = $2200. Next, calculate the number of teachers needed: 203 students / 35 students per group = 5.829 \u2248 6 teachers. Total number of people: 203 students + 6 teachers = 209 people. Cost per person: $2200 / 209 people \u2248 $10.53",
