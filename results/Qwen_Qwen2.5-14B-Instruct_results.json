      "original_solution": "This question contains flawed logic and ambiguous wording. The phrase 'the actual speed of the train is exactly double the speed given' is unclear because there is no 'speed given' explicitly mentioned in the problem. The calculation for speed, using the basic formula speed = distance/time, would provide an initial speed of 60 mph (120 miles / 2 hours). However, doubling this speed leads to an unexpected and contradictory result, as there's no explicit speed to double. The problem is self-referential without clear initial conditions or 'given' speeds.

      "original_question": "If a rectangle has a perimeter of 20 units, and the length of the rectangle is twice its width plus 3 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?",
      "original_solution": "The question is flawed for several reasons. Firstly, there is contradictory information regarding the possible dimensions of the rectangle when calculated. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2(l + w) = 20, where l is the length and w is the width. The condition that the length l = 2w + 3 adds complexity. Substituting l into the perimeter formula gives 2((2w + 3) + w) = 20, leading to the equation 6w + 6 = 20, which simplifies to w = 2.33. However, w must be a whole number since the length and the width usually are not fractional in such standard math problems without additional context. Furthermore, the problem does not clarify if fractional answers are acceptable or expected, leaving the requirement unclear. The question lacks instructions on whether the rectangle's dimensions must be integers or can be any real numbers, making it impossible to decisively solve this question with the given information.",

The statement 'If you double a number, then add 10, the result is 3' suggests that 2x + 10 = 3. Solving this equation results in a calculation of x = -3.5. However, the prompt's requirement to 'consider all possible scenarios' adds to the ambiguity because the given linear equation has only one solution, unless we are supposed to interpret it in a non-standard way (e.g., considering complex numbers or different mathematical operations not apparent in the standard reading of the equation). Moreover, the 'consider all possible scenarios' is vague, as there is no clear indication of what scenarios should be considered outside the given equation, if any. This leads to multiple interpretations of what kind of solutions and explanations are expected.",

      "current_solution": "This question contains flawed logic and ambiguous wording. The phrase 'the actual speed of the train is exactly double the speed given' is unclear because there is no 'speed given' explicitly mentioned in the problem. The calculation for speed, using the basic formula speed = distance/time, would provide an initial speed of 60 mph (120 miles / 2 hours). However, doubling this speed leads to an unexpected and contradictory result, as there's no explicit speed to double. The problem is self-referential without clear initial conditions or 'given' speeds. The question requires either a different sentence structure or additional information about the 'speed given' to make sense, and without this, it's impossible to determine the true conditions or solution.",

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2(l + w) = 20, where l is the length and w is the width. The condition that the length l = 2w + 3 adds complexity. Substituting l into the perimeter formula gives 2((2w + 3) + w) = 20, leading to the equation 6w + 6 = 20, which simplifies to w = 2.33. However, w must be a whole number since the length and the width usually are not fractional in such standard math problems without additional context. Furthermore, the problem does not clarify if fractional answers are acceptable or expected, leaving the requirement unclear. The question lacks instructions on whether the rectangle's dimensions must be integers or can be any real numbers, making it impossible to decisively solve this question with the given information.",
