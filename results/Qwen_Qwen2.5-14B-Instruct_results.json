      "original_solution": "This question contains flawed logic and ambiguous wording. The phrase 'the actual speed of the train is exactly double the speed given' is unclear because there is no 'speed given' explicitly mentioned in the problem. The calculation for speed, using the basic formula speed = distance/time, would provide an initial speed of 60 mph (120 miles / 2 hours). However, doubling this speed leads to an unexpected and contradictory result, as there's no explicit speed to double. The problem is self-referential without clear initial conditions or 'given' speeds.

      "original_question": "If a rectangle has a perimeter of 20 units, and the length of the rectangle is twice its width plus 3 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?",
      "original_solution": "The question is flawed for several reasons. Firstly, there is contradictory information regarding the possible dimensions of the rectangle when calculated. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2(l + w) = 20, where l is the length and w is the width. The condition that the length l = 2w + 3 adds complexity. Substituting l into the perimeter formula gives 2((2w + 3) + w) = 20, leading to the equation 6w + 6 = 20, which simplifies to w = 2.33. However, w must be a whole number since the length and the width usually are not fractional in such standard math problems without additional context. Furthermore, the problem does not clarify if fractional answers are acceptable or expected, leaving the requirement unclear. The question lacks instructions on whether the rectangle's dimensions must be integers or can be any real numbers, making it impossible to decisively solve this question with the given information.",

However, the prompt's requirement to 'consider all possible scenarios' adds to the ambiguity because the given linear equation has only one solution, unless we are supposed to interpret it in a non-standard way (e.g., considering complex numbers or different mathematical operations not apparent in the standard reading of the equation). Moreover, the 'consider all possible scenarios' is vague, as there is no clear indication of what scenarios should be considered outside the given equation, if any.

However, the expected solution is incomplete and contains errors, such as the incorrect calculation of rotten apples and the lack of a final weight calculation. To improve, ensure the expected solution is complete and accurate, addressing all parts of the problem. Additionally, clarify the narrative to ensure it aligns with the calculations, and provide a clear, step-by-step solution that includes all necessary operations and checks for integer values where applicable.; Clarify the number of rotten apples by ensuring it results in an integer value. For example, adjust the number of apples picked or the percentage of rotten apples.; Simplify the narrative by reducing the number of steps and ensuring each step logically follows the previous one. For instance, have Sarah pick a specific number of apples that results in a clear, integer number of non-rotten apples.; Enhance the narrative context to make it more engaging and realistic.

If the length of the garden is increased by 3 units while the width remains unchanged, the area of the garden increases by 20 square units. What is the original width of the garden?\",\n    \"solution\": \"Let the original width of the garden be \\( w \\) units. Since the length is twice the width, the original length is \\( 2w \\) units.

      "current_solution": "The question is flawed due to contradictory information. It first describes a rectangular garden by stating that the length is twice the width and gives a perimeter condition, which are standard characteristics of a rectangle. However, the follow-up question about the area asks for a scenario where the garden has '4 equal sides,' which contradicts the original condition of having a different length and width. The problem could either be about a rectangle with specified conditions or a square, but not both. The error arises from trying to merge these two distinct scenarios into one problem, leaving the reader confused about the actual shape and its properties.",

Since the total distance between the towns is 600 km, we can set up the equation: 80(t + 2) + 100t = 600. Simplifying, we get 80t + 160 + 100t = 600, which simplifies further to 180t + 160 = 600. Solving for t, we get 180t = 440, so t = 440 / 180 \u2248 2.44 hours. Therefore, the trains meet approximately 2.44 hours after the second train leaves, which is about 2 hours and 27 minutes.

        "The new problem effectively addresses the ambiguity present in the previous problem by specifying the total distance and dividing it into two clear segments. This allows for a straightforward calculation of average speed using the total distance and total time. To further enhance the problem, consider adding a real-life context or scenario that might require such calculations, such as a train schedule or a travel itinerary, to increase engagement and relatability. Additionally, ensure that the problem encourages students to think critically about the relationship between speed, distance, and time, perhaps by asking them to explore what happens if the speeds or distances change."
