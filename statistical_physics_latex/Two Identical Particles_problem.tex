\section*{Problem 1: Two Identical Particles}
A system consists of two identical, non-interacting, spinless (no spin variables at all) particles. 
The system has only three single-particle states $\psi_1, \psi_2$, and $\psi_3$ with energies $t_1 = 0 < t_2 < t_3$ 
respectively. 

\begin{itemize}
\item[a)] List in a vertical column all the two-particle states available to the system, along 
with their energies, if the particles are Fermions. Use the occupation number notation 
$(n_1,n_2,n_3)$ to identify each state. Indicate which state is occupied at $T = 0$. 
\item[b)] Repeat a) for the case of Bose particles. 
\item[c)] Use the Canonical Ensemble to write the partition function for both Fermi and Bose 
cases. 
\item[d)] Using only the leading two terms in the partition function, ﬁnd the temperature dependence of the internal energy in each case. Contrast the behavior of the internal 
energy near $T = 0$ in the two cases. 
\end{itemize}

\section*{Problem 2: A Number of Two-State Particles}
Consider a collection of N identical, non-interacting, spinless Bose particles. There are only 
two single-particle energy eigenstates: $\psi_0$ with energy $t = 0$ and $\psi_1$ with energy $t = \Delta$. 

\begin{itemize}
\item[a)] How would you index the possible N-body energy eigenstates in the occupation number 
representation? What are their energies? How many N-body states are there in all? 
\item[b)] Find a closed form expression for the partition function $Z(N, T )$ using the Canonical 
Ensemble. 
Not indexed: 6
\item[c)] What is the probability $p(n)$ that $n$ particles will be found in the excited state $\psi_1$? 
\item[d)] Find the partition function $Zd(N, T )$ that would apply if the $N$ particles were distin­
guishable but possessed the same single particle states as above. 

\end{itemize}

Please replace the placeholder text with desired content. The words in brackets [..] are placeholders where you can replace the LaTeX code that you've given. You can usually expect placeholders in LaTeX code provide by an assistant like me. An assistant cannot convert into LaTeX, codes that depends on context or needs specific LaTeX packages. It is advisable to fill in the placeholders with the accurate LaTeX commands as per the representation or results you desire.
