\section*{Problem 1: True or False (20 points)}
Determine whether the following statements are True or False. Explain your answer.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Consider the Cournot duopoly model with linear demand and asymmetric costs (that is, the cost functions are $C(q_{1}) = c_{1}q_{1}$ for firm 1 and $C(q_{2}) = c_{2}q_{2}$ for firm 2). In the equilibrium of the game,
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item [a.] \textbf{Claim 1:} both firms will be producing strictly positive quantities.
      \item \textbf{Solution:} False, if the difference between productivities is sufficiently large, the most inefficient firm will be driven out of the market and produce zero.
      \item [b.] \textbf{Claim 2:} the firm with the lowest cost will be producing a higher quantity than its competitor.
      \item \textbf{Solution:} True, the firm with the lowest cost will always produce a higher quantity than its competitor.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
