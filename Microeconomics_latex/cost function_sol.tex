\section*{Fall 2018 14.01 Problem Set 3 - Solutions}

\subsection*{Problem 1 (28 points)}
True/False/Uncertain. Please fully explain your answer, including diagrams where appropriate. Points are awarded based on explanations.

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)] (4 points) The short run marginal cost curve is always increasing due to the law of diminishing marginal returns. \\
\textbf{Solution:} False. The law of diminishing marginal returns means that the marginal cost curve will eventually be increasing. However, at low levels of the input, there can be increasing marginal returns to an input, and MC may decrease at first.

\item[(2)] (4 points) In the short run, perfectly competitive firms with higher fixed costs must also charge a higher price, all else equal. \\
\textbf{Solution:} False. Perfectly competitive firms cannot alter their price - they are price takers of the market price. Furthermore, in the short run, fixed costs are equivalent to sunk costs, and will not affect the firm's decision making. \(MC(q) = p\) will hold, and this condition will determine their level of output.
