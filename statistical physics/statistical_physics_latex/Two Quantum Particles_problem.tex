\section*{Problem 1: Two Quantum Particles}
A possible wavefunction for two particles (1 and 2) moving in one dimension is 
\[
\psi(x_1,x_2) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi x_0^2}} (x_2 - x_1) \exp\left[ -\frac{(x_1^2 + x_2^2)}{2x_0^2} \right]
\]
where $x_0$ is a characteristic distance. \\
a) What is the joint probability density p($x_1, x_2$) for finding particle 1 at $x = x_1$ and particle 2 at $x = x_2$? On a sketch of the $x_1, x_2$ plane indicate where the joint probab...

\section*{Problem 2: Pyramidal Density}
The joint probability density p($x, y$) for two random variables $x$ and $y$ is given below.
\[
p(x, y) =
\begin{cases} 
      6(1 - x - y) & \text{if } 0 \leq x, 0 \leq y, x + y \leq 1 \\
      0 & \text{otherwise }
   \end{cases}
\]

Please note that the text in the problems are not complete. But this gives you the general idea of how to write such documents in LaTeX. Complete each problem with the remaining text in your document. Also, you might want to encapsulate your text inside `\text{}` if it is plain text. There are also packages to handle images if you are including images in your document.
