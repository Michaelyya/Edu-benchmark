\noindent\textbf{Problem 1: Sound Waves in a Solid}

[Content omitted for brevity]

where $v$ is the velocity of the wave. If the frequency of the sound wave is high enough -- which is usually the case -- the irreversible heat flow mentioned above can be neglected and the process treated as adiabatic.

The equation of state of the solid can be approximated by the expression:
\begin{equation*}
V = V_0 (1 + \alpha T - \kappa_T P)
\end{equation*}

[Content omitted for brevity]

Find the ratio of the temperature excursion to the pressure excursion, $\Delta T / \Delta P$, in terms of $\alpha$, $\kappa_T$, $T$, and the constant volume heat capacity per unit volume, $C_V / V_0$.
