Since \( AB \) and \( PD \) are vertical, and \( AP \) and \( BD \) are horizontal, \( ABDP \) is a rectangle, which means that \( PD = 5 \, \text{m} \) and \( AP = 24 \, \text{m} \).

Since \( CD = 15 \, \text{m} \) and \( PD = 5 \, \text{m} \), then 
\[
CP = CD - PD = 10 \, \text{m}.
\]

By the Pythagorean Theorem,
\[
AC = \sqrt{AP^2 + CP^2} = \sqrt{(24 \, \text{m})^2 + (10 \, \text{m})^2} = \sqrt{676 \, \text{m}^2} = 26 \, \text{m},
\]
since \( AC > 0 \).

Since the bird flies \( 26 \, \text{m} \) at \( 4 \, \text{m/s} \), its time to complete the flight is
\[
\frac{26 \, \text{m}}{4 \, \text{m/s}} = 6.5 \, \text{s}.

\textbf{Note:} In soccer, each team’s score is always a non-negative integer that never decreases as the game proceeds.","\section*{Solution}
Since Team Why had scored 3 goals at the end of the game, then \( y \leq 3 \). Since Team Zed had scored 2 goals at the end of the game, then \( z \leq 2 \). Therefore, 
\[
0 \leq y \leq 3 \quad \text{and} \quad 0 \leq z \leq 2.
\]
The only additional restriction is that \( y \) and \( z \) are both integers.

Thus, there are 4 possible values for \( y \) and 3 possible values for \( z \), which means that there are:
\[
4 \cdot 3 = 12 \quad \text{possible pairs } (y, z).

These pairs correspond to the possible scores at half-time.

2024A04,"For how many ordered quadruples (a, b, c, d) of positive integers with d ≤ 8 is d equal to the product of a, b and c? (That is, for how many such ordered quadruples is abc = d?)",N,"For how many ordered quadruples \((a, b, c, d)\) of positive integers with \(d \leq 8\) is \(d\) equal to the product of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\)? (That is, for how many such ordered quadruples is \(abc = d\)?)","\section*{Solution}
We are told that \(a, b, c, d\) are positive integers with \(abc = d\) and \(d \leq 8\).  
We determine the number of possible quadruples \((a, b, c, d)\) by looking at each possible value of \(d\).  

If \(d = 1\), then \(abc = 1\). Since \(a, b, c\) are positive integers, \(a = b = c = 1\).  
This means that there is 1 quadruple in this case, namely \((1, 1, 1, 1)\).  

If \(d = 2\), then \(abc = 2\). Since 2 is prime, one of \(a, b, c\) equals 2, and the other two variables equal 1.  
This gives 3 quadruples: \((a, b, c, d) = (2, 1, 1, 2), (1, 2, 1, 2), (1, 1, 2, 2)\).  

Similarly, when \(d = 3, d = 5,\) and \(d = 7\) (the other possible prime values of \(d\)), there are 3 quadruples for each case.  

If \(d = 4\), then \(abc = 4\). We need to determine the ways in which 4 can be factored as the product of three positive integers.  
These ways are \(1 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 = 4\) and \(1 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 4\).  

In each case, there are 3 ways to arrange the factors on the left side, which are the possible values of \(a, b, c\):  
\[
1 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 = 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 1 = 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 4  
\]
\[
1 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 2 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 4  
\]
Thus, there are 6 quadruples in this case.  

If \(d = 6\), then \(abc = 6\). The possible factorizations of 6 into three positive factors are \(1 \cdot 1 \cdot 6 = 6\) and \(1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 = 6\).  

In the first case, there are again 3 quadruples.  
In the second case, there are 6 ways of arranging the factors:  
\[
1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 = 1 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 = 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 3 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 1 = 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 2 = 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 6  
\]
Thus, if \(d = 6\), there are 9 quadruples.  

If \(d = 8\), then \(abc = 8\). The possible factorizations of 8 into three positive factors are \(1 \cdot 1 \cdot 8 = 8\), \(1 \cdot 2 \cdot 4 = 8\), and \(2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 8\).  

These cases give 3, 6, and 1 quadruples, for a total of 10.

If the area of hexagon \(PQRSTU\) is \(\sqrt{n}\), where \(n\) and \(t\) are positive integers with \(t\) as small as possible, 
what is the ordered pair \((n, t)\)?","We use coordinate geometry. Suppose that \(F\) is the origin and \(E\) lies on the positive \(x\)-axis.  
The coordinates of \(F\) are \((0, 0)\). Since \(FE = 6\), the coordinates of \(E\) are \((6, 0)\).  

Next, we find the coordinates of \(B\).  
We note that \(FA = AB = 2\).  
Since the six interior angles of hexagon \(ABCDEF\) are equal, the measure of each is equal to \(\frac{1}{6} \cdot 720^\circ = 120^\circ\).  
(The sum of the measures of the interior angles of any hexagon is \(720^\circ\).)  
This means that \(\triangle FAB\) is isosceles with \(FA = AB = 2\) and \(\angle FAB = 120^\circ\).  

Since \(\angle FAB = 120^\circ\), then \(\angle AFB = \angle ABF = \frac{1}{2}(180^\circ - 120^\circ) = 30^\circ\).  
Since \(\angle AFE = 120^\circ\) and \(\angle AFB = 30^\circ\), then \(\angle BFE = \angle AFE - \angle AFB = 90^\circ\),  
which means that \(BF\) is vertical and so \(B\) lies on the positive \(y\)-axis.  

If we draw a perpendicular from \(A\) to a point \(M\) on \(BF\), then, because \(\triangle FAB\) is isosceles,  
\(M\) is the midpoint of \(BF\) and \(AM\) bisects \(\angle FAB\).This means that \(\triangle BAM\) is a 30°-60°-90° triangle.  
Thus, \(BM = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} AB = \sqrt{3}\) and so \(BF = 2\sqrt{3}\), which means that the coordinates of \(B\) are \((0, 2\sqrt{3})\).  

(We could have determined the length of \(BF\) using the cosine law in \(\triangle BAF\).)  
Also, \(AM = \frac{1}{2} AB = 1\). This means that the coordinates of \(A\) are \((-1, \sqrt{3})\).  

Using similar arguments, the coordinates of \(C\) are \((6, 2\sqrt{3})\), and the coordinates of \(D\) are \((7, \sqrt{3})\).  

We can determine the area of hexagon \(PQRSTU\) by starting with the area of rectangle \(BCEF\)  
(which is \(6 \cdot 2\sqrt{3} = 12\sqrt{3}\)) and subtracting the areas of \(\triangle UFT, \triangle BPQ, \triangle CRQ, \triangle SET, \triangle BCQ, \text{ and } \triangle FET\).  

By symmetry, the areas of \(\triangle BPQ, \triangle CRQ, \triangle SET\) are all equal.  
Also, by symmetry, the areas of \(\triangle BCQ \text{ and } \triangle FET\) are equal.  

We determine the area of \(\triangle UFT\) and the area of \(\triangle FET\).  
To do this, we determine the coordinates of \(U\) and of \(T\).  

The line segment \(FD\) passes through \(F(0, 0)\) and \(D(7, \sqrt{3})\).  
Thus, it has slope \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{7}\) and equation \(y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{7} x\).  

The line segment \(AE\) passes through \(A(-1, \sqrt{3})\) and \(E(6, 0)\).  
Thus, it has slope \(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{7}\) and equation \(y = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{7}(x - 6) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{7} x + \frac{6\sqrt{3}}{7}\).  

This means that the coordinates of \(U\) (which is the \(y\)-intercept of this line) are \((0, \frac{6\sqrt{3}}{7})\).  

To find the coordinates of \(T\), we find the point of intersection of \(AE\) and \(FD\).  
Equating expressions for \(y\), we obtain \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{7} x = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{7} x + \frac{6\sqrt{3}}{7}\), which gives \(\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{7} x = \frac{6\sqrt{3}}{7}\) or \(x = 3\).  
(It should not be surprising that the \(x\)-coordinate of \(T\) is \(x = 3\).)  

When \(x = 3\), we obtain \(y = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{7}\), and so the coordinates of \(T\) are \((3, \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{7})\).  

So, \(\triangle FET\) has base \(FE = 6\) and height equal to the distance from \(T\) to \(FE\) (which is \(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{7}\)).  
Thus, the area of \(\triangle FET\) is \(\frac{1}{2} \cdot 6 \cdot \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{7} = \frac{9\sqrt{3}}{7}\).  

Also, \(\triangle UFT\) has vertical base \(UF\) (which has length \(\frac{6\sqrt{3}}{7}\)) and horizontal height equal to the distance from \(T\) to \(UF\) (which is \(3\)).  
Thus, the area of \(\triangle UFT\) is \(\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{6\sqrt{3}}{7} \cdot 3 = \frac{9\sqrt{3}}{7}\).  

(Can you see a reason why this should be equal to the area of \(\triangle FET\)?)  

Finally, this means that the area of \(PQRSTU\) is equal to \(12\sqrt{3} - 6 - \frac{9\sqrt{3}}{7} - \frac{84\sqrt{3}}{7} = \frac{54\sqrt{3}}{7}\),  
which equals \(\frac{2700}{7}\).

For example, \(70, 700, 1254\) is a Gleeson list of length 3, and \(2, 4, 6, 10, 15, 987, 1000\) is a Gleeson list of length 7. Let \(M\) be the maximum possible length of a Gleeson list. How many Gleeson lists of length \(M\) are there?","\section*{Problem 6}

A list of distinct positive integers has a sum that is at least 
\[ 1 + 2 + \cdots + (m - 1) + m = \frac{1}{2}m(m+1). \]

We note that 
\[
\frac{1}{2} \cdot 63 \cdot 64 = 2016 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1}{2} \cdot 64 \cdot 65 = 2080.
\]
In other words, the sum 
\[
1 + 2 + \cdots + 63 + 64 = 63 + 64
\]
is greater than 2024, and any sum of more than 64 distinct positive integers is greater still.  
This means that a Gleeson list consists of at most 63 integers.  

Note that 
\[
1 + 2 + \cdots + 62 + 63 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 63 \cdot 64 = 2016
\]
and so 
\[
1 + 2 + \cdots + 62 + 63 + 8 = 2024,
\]
which means that 
\[
1 + 2 + \cdots + 61 + 62 + 71 = 2016.
\]

This means that there is at least one Gleeson list of length 63, and there cannot be a Gleeson list of length greater than 63, so \(M\), the maximum length of a Gleeson list, is 63.  
We need to determine the number of Gleeson lists of length \(M = 63\).  

Suppose that \(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_{62}, a_{63}\) is a Gleeson list.  
That is, \(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_{62}, a_{63}\) are positive integers with \(a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_{62} < a_{63}\) and  
\[
a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_{62} + a_{63} = 2024.
\]

For each \(j\) with \(1 \leq j \leq 63\), let \(b_j = a_j - j\), which means that \(a_j = j + b_j\).  
That is, we write a generic Gleeson list as  
\[
1 + b_1, 2 + b_2, \ldots, 62 + b_{62}, 63 + b_{63},
\]
where the \(b_j\)'s are the ""extra"" in each term.

For each \(j\) with \(1 \leq j \leq 62\), since \(a_j\) and \(a_{j+1}\) are integers with \(a_{j+1} > a_j\), then \(a_{j+1} \geq a_j + 1\).  
This means that \(j + 1 + b_{j+1} \geq j + b_j + 1\) or \(b_{j+1} \geq b_j\).  
This means that \(b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_{62}, b_{63}\) is a list of integers with \(b_1 \leq b_2 \leq \cdots \leq b_{62} \leq b_{63}\).  

Since \(a_1 = 1 + b_1 \geq 1\), then \(b_1 \geq 0\), and so  
\[
0 \leq b_1 \leq b_2 \leq \cdots \leq b_{62} \leq b_{63}.
\]
Also, since \(a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_{62} + a_{63} = 2024,\) then  
\[
(1 + b_1) + (2 + b_2) + \cdots + (62 + b_{62}) + (63 + b_{63}) = 2024.
\]

Since 
\[
1 + 2 + \cdots + 62 + 63 = 2016,
\]
then 
\[
b_1 + b_2 + \cdots + b_{62} + b_{63} = 8.
\]

In other words, to count the number of Gleeson lists of length 63, we need to count the number of non-decreasing lists of non-negative integers \(b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_{62}, b_{63}\) with a sum of 8.  

We determine these lists by categorizing them using the number of non-zero terms, in each case with the understanding that the terms before these are all 0.  

\begin{itemize}
    \item 1 non-zero term: 8
    \item 2 non-zero terms: \(1, 7; 2, 6; 3, 5; 4, 4\)
    \item 3 non-zero terms: \(1, 1, 6; 1, 2, 5; 1, 3, 4; 2, 2, 4; 2, 3, 3\)
    \item 4 non-zero terms: \(1, 1, 1, 5; 1, 1, 2, 4; 1, 1, 3, 3; 1, 2, 2, 3; 2, 2, 2, 2\)
    \item 5 non-zero terms: \(1, 1, 1, 1, 4; 1, 1, 1, 2, 3; 1, 1, 2, 2, 2\)
    \item 6 non-zero terms: \(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3; 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2\)
    \item 7 non-zero terms: \(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2\)
    \item 8 non-zero terms: \(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1\)
\end{itemize}

In each case, we determine the lists by starting with the largest possible entries at the right and adjusting to the left in a systematic way.  

There are 22 such lists, and so there are 22 Gleeson lists of length 63.

    p + q = 4 \quad \text{and} \quad p - q = 1.
    \]
    Adding these equations, we obtain \( 2p = 5 \), which gives \( p = 2.5 \). 

This means that there are no integers \( p \) and \( q \) that satisfy this equation.First, we note that \( 80 = 16 \cdot 5 = 2^4 \cdot 5^1 \). 

Since the right side contains only one factor of 5, this means that \( p - q = 1 \), which implies that \( p \) and \( q \) are either odd and even, or even and odd.  
    In turn, \( p + q \) is the sum of an even integer and an odd integer, so \( p + q \) is odd. But \( 80 \) includes an even number of factors of 2, and we know that the left side includes an odd number of factors of 2. 

This is a contradiction, and so there are no integers \( p \) and \( q \) that satisfy this equation.

Suppose that the polynomial $f(x) = x^2 + mx + p$ has two distinct positive real roots $x = r$ and $x = s$.  
This means that $r + s = -m$ and $rs = p$, as shown in part (a) of Solution 2.  

In this case,  
\[
m^2 - 2p = (-m)^2 - 2p = (r + s)^2 - 2rs = r^2 + 2rs + s^2 - 2rs = r^2 + s^2
\]
and  
\[
p^2 = (rs)^2 = r^2 s^2.
\]

This means that we can rewrite $g(x)$ as  
\[
g(x) = x^2 - (r^2 + s^2)x + r^2s^2
\]
which factors as  
\[
g(x) = (x - r^2)(x - s^2).
\]

(Can you see why this is true by looking at the sum and product of roots?)

Since $g(x) = (x - r^2)(x - s^2)$, then $g(x)$ has roots $r^2$ and $s^2$.  
We recall that $r$ and $s$ are positive and distinct.  
Since neither equals $0$, then $r^2$ and $s^2$ are positive.  
Since $r \neq \pm s$, then $r^2$ and $s^2$ are distinct.  

This means that $g(x)$ has two distinct positive real roots.

\section*{Solution 2}

We proceed by using the sum and product of roots as shown in part (a) of Solution 2.  
Suppose that the roots of $f(x) = x^2 + mx + p$ are $x = r$ and $x = s$.  
Since $r$ and $s$ are positive, then $r + s > 0$ and $rs > 0$.  
Since $r + s = -m$, then $m < 0$.  
Since $rs = p$, then $p > 0$.

Since $f(x)$ has two distinct real roots, then its discriminant is positive. In particular,  
\[
m^2 - 4p > 0
\]

Now, the discriminant of $g(x) = x^2 - (m^2 - 2p)x + p^2$ is  
\[
\Delta = (m^2 - 2p)^2 - 4(1)(p^2) = m^4 - 4m^2p + 4p^2 - 4p^2 = m^4 - 4m^2p
= m^2(m^2 - 4p).
\]

Since $m^2 > 0$ (because $m < 0$) and $m^2 - 4p > 0$, then  
\[
\Delta = m^2(m^2 - 4p) > 0.
\]

This means that $g(x)$ has two distinct real roots.  
Next, the sum of the (real) roots of $g(x)$ is $m^2 - 2p$ and their product is $p^2$.  

We note that  
\[
m^2 - 2p = (m^2 - 4p) + 2p
\]
which is the sum of two positive real numbers and so is positive.  

Also, $p^2$ is positive since $p > 0$.  
Since the product of the roots of $g(x)$ is positive, the roots are either both positive or both negative.  
Since the sum of the roots of $g(x)$ is positive, the roots cannot both be negative, and so both are positive.

Suppose that a cubic equation $x^3 + Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0$ has roots $x = r$, $x = s$, and $x = t$. As we saw in (a), this means that

and so  
\[
A = -(r + s + t), \quad B = rs + rt + st, \quad \text{and} \quad C = -rst.
\]

Also, if $A = -(r + s + t)$, $B = rs + rt + st$, and $C = -rst$, then a cubic equation with roots $r$, $s$, and $t$ is  
\[
x^3 + Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0.

Consider the polynomial  
\[
f_1(x) = x^3 + A_1x^2 + B_1x + C_1 = x^3 - 6x^2 + 10x - 5.

Since $f(1) = 1 - 6 + 10 - 5 = 0$, then $x = 1$ is a root.  
Factoring, we obtain  
\[
f_1(x) = (x - 1)(x^2 - 5x + 5).

By the quadratic formula, the roots of $x^2 - 5x + 5 = 0$ are

x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}.

We note that  
\[
\frac{5 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \approx 3.62 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{5 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \approx 1.38.

A_{n-1} = -(r + s + t), \quad B_{n-1} = rs + rt + st, \quad C_{n-1} = -rst

for some distinct, positive real numbers $r$, $s$, and $t$. Then  
\[
A_n = 2B_{n-1} - (A_{n-1})^2
\]
\[
= 2(rs + rt + st) - (-(r + s + t))^2

\[

\[

\[
= -(r^2 + s^2 + t^2).

\[
B_n = (B_{n-1})^2 - 2A_{n-1}C_{n-1}

= r^2s^2 + r^2t^2 + s^2t^2.

\]

This polynomial has roots $x = r^2$, $x = s^2$, and $x = t^2$, since the coefficients of the polynomial are the correct combinations of these roots.  
This means that the roots of $f_n(x)$ are the squares of the roots of $f_{n-1}(x)$.  

Here, $f_1(x)$ has three distinct positive real roots.  
Since the roots of $f_2(x)$ are the squares of the roots of $f_1(x)$, then they are real, positive, and distinct.  

Continuing in this way, the roots of $f_3(x)$, $f_4(x)$, $\ldots$, $f_{100}(x)$ will each be the squares of the roots of the previous polynomial in the list, and so will be real, positive, and distinct.  
Therefore, the polynomial $f_{100}(x)$ has three distinct positive real roots.

We note that, since the denominator of this fraction ($2n$) is even, then for $x$ to be an integer, the numerator of this fraction ($n^2 + m^2$) is also even. Since $n^2 + m^2$ must be even, then $n$ and $m$ are both even or both odd. We look at two cases: $m$ odd and $m$ even. \subsection*{Case 1: $m$ is odd} Since $m$ is odd, then $n$ is odd. \[ x = \frac{n^2 + m^2}{2n} = \frac{n^2}{2n} + \frac{m^2}{2n}. \] Since $\frac{n^2}{2n} = \frac{n}{2}$ is an odd integer divided by $2$, then for $x$ to be an integer, $\frac{m^2}{2n}$ must also equal an odd integer divided by $2$, which means that $n$ must equal an odd integer. Recalling that $n > m$, this means that we want to determine all odd integers $m$ with $1 \leq m \leq 100$ for which exactly $7$ integers $n$ with $m < n \leq m^2$ are divisors of $m^2$. Note that every divisor $n$ of $m^2$ with $m < n \leq m^2$ will correspond to a divisor $q$ of $m^2$ with $1 \leq q < m$. This correspondence comes from the factor pair $qn = m^2$ and noting \[ q = \frac{m^2}{n} \quad \text{from which} \quad m < n \leq m^2 \quad \text{gives} \quad \frac{m^2}{m} \leq q < m. \] Additionally, $m^2$ has the divisor $m$ for which we have not yet accounted. This means that we want to determine all odd integers $m$ with $1 \leq m \leq 100$ for which $m^2$ has exactly $2 \cdot 7 + 1 = 15$ positive divisors. If $m$ has three distinct prime divisors $p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$, then $m^2$ is divisible by the product $p_1^2p_2^2p_3^2$. This means that $m^2$ has at least $(2 + 1)(2 + 1)(2 + 1) = 27$ positive divisors, which is impossible. Therefore, $m$ can have at most two distinct prime divisors. Suppose that $m = p_1^a$ for some prime $p_1$ and positive integer $a$. Then $m^2 = p_1^{2a}$ and $m^2$ has $2a + 1$ positive divisors. Since $m^2$ has $15$ positive divisors, then $2a + 1 = 15$ which gives $a = 7$ and so $m = p_1^7$. However, the smallest odd perfect seventh power is $3^7 > 100$, and so there are no $m$ in this sub-case. Suppose that $m = p_1^a p_2^b$ for some odd primes $p_1 \neq p_2$ and positive integers $a$ and $b$. Thus, $m^2 = p_1^{2a} p_2^{2b}$ and $m^2$ has $(2a + 1)(2b + 1)$ divisors. Since $2a + 1 \geq 3$ and $2b + 1 \geq 3$ and $(2a + 1)(2b + 1) = 15$, then $2a + 1$ and $2b + 1$ must be $5$ and $3$ in some order, which means that $a$ and $b$ must be $2$ and $1$ in some order. Thus, $m = p_1^2p_2$ for some odd primes $p_1$ and $p_2$. If $p_1 = 3$, then since $m = 9p_2$ and $1 \leq m \leq 100$, we can have $m = 45$ (from $p_2 = 5$) or $m = 63$ (from $p_2 = 7$) or $m = 99$ (from $p_2 = 11$). If $p_1 = 5$, then since $m = 25p_2$ and $1 \leq m \leq 100$, we can have $m = 75$ (from $p_2 = 3$). If $p_1 \geq 7$, there are no odd primes $p_2$ for which $m \leq 100$. Therefore, in the case that $m$ is odd, the possible values for $m$ are $m = 45, 63, 75, 99$. \subsection*{Case 2: $m$ is even} Since $m$ is even, then $n$ is even. Let $m = 2M$ and $n = 2N$ for some positive integers $M$ and $N$. Since $1 \leq 2M \leq 100$, then $0.5 \leq M \leq 50$ and so $1 \leq M \leq 50$. Here, \[ x = \frac{4N^2 + 4M^2}{4N} = N + \frac{M^2}{N}. \] Since $N$ is an integer, then for $x$ to be an integer, $\frac{M^2}{N}$ must also equal an integer. Since $n > m$, then $N > M$. This means that we want to determine all integers $M$ with $1 \leq M \leq 50$ for which exactly $7$ integers $N$ with $M < N \leq M^2$ are divisors of $M^2$. As above, this means that we want to determine all integers $M$ with $1 \leq M \leq 50$ for which $M^2$ has exactly $15$ positive divisors. If $M = p_1^2p_2$ for some primes $p_1$ and $p_2$, then we proceed similarly as above. If $p_1 = 2$, then since $M = 4p_2$ and $1 \leq M \leq 50$, we can have $M = 12$ (from $p_2 = 3$) or $M = 20$ (from $p_2 = 5$) or $M = 28$ (from $p_2 = 7$) or $M = 44$ (from $p_2 = 11$). If $p_1 = 3$, then since $M = 9p_2$ and $1 \leq M \leq 50$, we can have $M = 18$ (from $p_2 = 2$) or $M = 45$ (from $p_2 = 5$). If $p_1 = 5$, then since $M = 25p_2$ and $1 \leq M \leq 50$, we can have $M = 50$ (from $p_2 = 2$). Since $m = 2M$, the possible values of $m$ in this case are $m = 24, 40, 56, 88, 36, 90, 100$. Combining the two cases, the values of $m$ are \[ m = 24, 36, 40, 45, 56, 63, 75, 88, 90, 99, 100. \]",Geometry,Metric or trigonometric relations,"Determines, through exploration or deduction, different metric relations associated

From the pie graph, the number of students who chose green is \( 0.35N \), and the number of students who chose blue is \( 0.45N \).  
All other students chose red, so the number of students who chose red is:
\[
N - 0.35N - 0.45N = 0.2N.
\]
From the bar graph, the number of students who chose red is 8, so:
\[
0.2N = 8.
\]
Dividing both sides of this equation by 0.2 gives:
\[
N = \frac{8}{0.2} = 40.
\]

\subsection*{Solution 2}
From the pie graph, 35\% of the students chose green, and 45\% chose blue.  
The rest of the students chose red, so the percentage of students that chose red is:
\[
100\% - 35\% - 45\% = 20\%.
\]
This means \( 20\% = \frac{1}{5} \) of the students chose red.  
From the bar graph, 8 students chose red.  
Thus, the total number of students surveyed is:
\[
8 \times 5 = 40.

In an equilateral triangle, each angle measures \( 60^\circ \), so \( \angle CDB = 60^\circ \).  
In a square, each angle measures \( 90^\circ \), so \( \angle BDE = 90^\circ \).  
Using this, we have:
\[
\angle CDE = \angle CDB + \angle BDE = 60^\circ + 90^\circ = 150^\circ.
\]
Since \( \triangle BCD \) is equilateral, \( CD = BD \).  
Since \( ABDE \) is a square, \( ED = BD \).  
Therefore, \( ED = BD = CD \).  

Since \( CD = ED \), \( \triangle CDE \) is isosceles, and so \( \angle CED = \angle ECD \).  
The angles in a triangle sum to \( 180^\circ \), so:
\[
180^\circ = \angle CDE + \angle ECD + \angle CED.
\]
Substituting \( \angle CED = \angle ECD \) and \( \angle CDE = 150^\circ \) gives:
\[
180^\circ = 150^\circ + \angle ECD + \angle ECD,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
30^\circ = 2\angle ECD, \quad \text{or} \quad \angle ECD = 15^\circ.
\]
Using \( \triangle BCD \), we have:
\[
\angle BCD = 60^\circ = \angle ECB + \angle ECD.
\]
Substituting \( \angle ECD = 15^\circ \) gives:
\[
\angle ECB = 60^\circ - 15^\circ = 45^\circ.

What is the greatest possible value of a?,N,"The positive integers $a$ and $b$ satisfy $2a < b$. The sum $\frac{a}{4} + \frac{b}{2}$ is greater than 27 and less than 28. What is the greatest possible value of $a$?
    ","\subsection*{4. Solution}
Suppose \( a = 21 \) and \( b = 44 \).  
Then:
\[
2a = 2 \times 21 = 42, \quad \text{which is less than} \quad b = 44, \quad \text{so} \quad 2a < b.
\]
Additionally:
\[
a + b = 21 + 44 = \frac{5}{4} + \frac{22}{4} = 27.25,
\]
which is greater than 27 and less than 28.  
We have shown that when \( a = 21 \), it is possible to choose \( b \) so that the conditions are satisfied.

Now suppose \( a \geq 22 \). Then:
\[
2a \geq 2 \times 22 \quad \text{or} \quad 2a \geq 44.
\]
If \( b > 2a \), then \( b > 44 \).  
Since \( b \) is a positive integer and \( b > 44 \), it must be true that \( b \geq 45 \).  
Thus, if \( a \geq 22 \), we must have \( b \geq 45 \).  

Putting \( a \geq 22 \) and \( b \geq 45 \) together, we get:
\[
a + b \geq 22 + 45 = \frac{5.5}{4} + \frac{22.5}{4} = 28.
\]
It is given that \( \frac{a}{4} + 2b \) must be less than 28, so we conclude that when \( a \geq 22 \), it is not possible to choose \( b \) so that all conditions are satisfied.  

Therefore, the greatest possible value of \( a \) is 21.

How many different two-digit integers are in exactly 5 of the cells in the table?","\subsection*{5. Solution}
We will refer to the seven columns from left to right as \( C_1, C_2, \dots, C_7 \).  
In every row, the integer in \( C_1 \) is 5.  

In the first row, the integer in \( C_2 \) is 5. In the second row, the integer in \( C_2 \) is 6.  
In the third row, the integer in \( C_2 \) is 7.  
As we follow \( C_2 \) downward, every integer is one more than the previous integer, so in the \( n \)-th row, the integer in \( C_2 \) is:
\[
n + 4.
\]
The first two integers in the \( n \)-th row are 5 and \( n + 4 \). Using the problem statement:
\[
\text{The third integer in the \( n \)-th row is } 5 + (n + 4) = n + 9.
\]
\[
\text{The fourth integer in the \( n \)-th row is } (n + 4) + (n + 9) = 2n + 13.
\]
\item The fifth integer in the $n$th row is:
    \[
    (n+9) + (2n+13) = 3n+22.
    \]
    \item The sixth integer in the $n$th row is:
    \[
    (2n+13) + (3n+22) = 5n+35.
    \]
    \item The seventh integer in the $n$th row is:
    \[
    (3n+22) + (5n+35) = 8n+57.
    \]

    To summarize, the integers in the $n$th row, from left to right, are:
    \[
    5, n+4, n+9, 2n+13, 3n+22, 5n+35, 8n+57.
    \]

    We are looking for two-digit integers that appear in exactly five of the cells. Since $C_1$ contains no two-digit integers, it can be ignored. In $C_2$ through $C_7$, the integers increase moving down the column, so none of these columns contains the same integer multiple times. Thus, we are looking for two-digit integers appearing in exactly five of the columns.

    The integers in $C_2$ are $n+4$ where $n$ ranges from 1 through 95, or the integers 5 through 99. The integers in $C_3$ are $n+9$ where $n$ ranges from 1 through 95, or the integers 10 through 104. Thus, $C_2$ and $C_3$ each contain every two-digit integer, so we are really looking for two-digit integers that are in exactly three of $C_4$, $C_5$, $C_6$, and $C_7$.

    The integers in $C_7$ are those of the form $8n + 57$, the first few of which are:
    \[
    8(1) + 57 = 65, \quad 8(2) + 57 = 73, \quad 8(3) + 57 = 81, \quad 8(4) + 57 = 89, \quad 8(5) + 57 = 97.
    \]
    All other integers in $C_7$ have at least three digits, so the only two-digit integers in $C_7$ are 65, 73, 81, 89, and 97.

    \textbf{Case 1: Integers not in $C_7$ but in $C_4$, $C_5$, and $C_6$.}

    Suppose a two-digit integer $x$ is in $C_4$, $C_5$, and $C_6$, but not in $C_7$. The integers in $C_6$ are of the form $5n+35$, and so are multiples of 5 that are greater than 35. The integers in $C_4$ are of the form $2n+13$, which are odd integers greater than 13. We conclude that $x$ is a two-digit odd multiple of 5 greater than 35, so it must be one of 45, 55, 65, 75, 85, or 95.

    We need to check which of these values of $x$ are in $C_5$. To determine whether an integer $x$ is in a given column, we set $x$ equal to the expression for that column and solve for $n$. If the solution $n$ is a positive integer from 1 through 95, then $x$ is in the $n$th row (in the column of interest). Otherwise, $x$ is not in that column. For example:
    \[
    55 = 3n + 22 \implies n = 11 \quad \text{(integer, so 55 is in $C_5$)}.
    \]
    However:
    \[
    45 = 3n + 22 \implies n = 7.67 \quad \text{(not an integer, so 45 is not in $C_5$)}.
    \]

    Checking all $x$ values, only 55 and 85 give integer solutions, so they are the only two-digit integers in $C_4$, $C_5$, and $C_6$ but not in $C_7$.

    \textbf{Case 2: Integers in $C_7$ and exactly two of $C_4$, $C_5$, and $C_6$.}

    In the table below, we check each of the two-digit integers in $C_7$ to see in which of $C_4$, $C_5$, and $C_6$ they also appear.

    \[
    \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    x & \text{Solution to } x = 2n+13 & \text{In } C_4? & \text{Solution to } x = 3n+22 & \text{In } C_5? & \text{Solution to } x = 5n+35 & \text{In } C_6? & \# \text{ of Columns} \\

    From the table, 65, 73, and 97 are the only two-digit integers in $C_7$ and exactly two of $C_4$, $C_5$, and $C_6$.

    \textbf{Final Answer:}

    Combining the two cases, there are five two-digit integers that are in exactly five cells. They are:

The eight points are labelled randomly using integers 1 through 8. 
What is the probability that at least one diameter connects a multiple of 3 at one end and a multiple of 2 at the other?","\section*{Solution 1}

We will compute the probability that the condition fails, then subtract the result from 1.  
The given condition is that at least one diameter has a multiple of 3 at one end and a multiple of 2 at the opposite end.  
For this condition to fail, there must be no diameter with this property.  

There are only two available multiples of 3, namely $3$ and $6$.  
To ensure the condition fails, we need to ensure that the diameters containing $3$ and $6$ do not have an even integer at the other end.  

Consider the diameter with $3$ at one end. At the other end must be an odd integer, but we cannot use $3$ twice, so we must place $1$, $5$, or $7$ at the other end. Similarly, the diameter with $6$ at one end must have an odd integer at its other end, but we cannot use $3$ since this would mean an even integer is at the other end of the diameter with $3$. Therefore, the condition fails exactly when $3$ and $6$ are on different diameters, and the two diameters with $3$ and $6$ each have one of $1$, $5$, or $7$ at their other end.  

We will now compute the probability that this happens.  
There are $8$ possibilities for the position of the integer $1$.  
Once $1$ is placed, there are $7$ possibilities for the position of the integer $2$. Continuing in this way, once $1$ and $2$ are placed, there are $6$ possibilities for the position of the integer $3$, then $5$ possibilities for the integer $4$, and so on until we get to the integer $8$, which will have only one possibility for where it can be placed.  
Thus, there are $8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$ possible ways to place the integers.  

Next, we will count the ways to place the integers so that $3$ and $6$ both share a diameter with one of $1$, $5$, or $7$.  
There are $8$ ways to place the integer $3$.  
After the integer $3$ is placed, there are $3$ choices for the integer at the other end of the diameter containing $3$, for a total of $8 \times 3 = 24$ ways to place $3$ and the other integer on its diameter. Once these integers are placed, there are $6$ ways to place the $6$.  

One of the integers from $1$, $5$, and $7$ has already been used, so there are $2$ choices for the integer at the other end of the diameter containing $6$.  
Thus, there are $8 \times 3 \times 6 \times 2$ ways to select and place the integers on the diameters containing $3$ and $6$. The remaining four integers, whatever they happen to be, can now be placed arbitrarily, and the condition will still be guaranteed to fail.  
By reasoning similar to earlier, there are $4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$ ways to place the remaining four integers.  

The probability that the condition fails is:  
\[
\frac{8 \times 3 \times 6 \times 2 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1}{8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{3 \times 2}{7 \times 5} = \frac{6}{35}.
\]
Hence, the probability that the condition is satisfied is:  
\[
1 - \frac{6}{35} = \frac{29}{35}.
\]

\section*{Solution 2}

As explained in Solution 1, there are $8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 40,320$ possible ways to arrange the integers. We will count the number of ways to arrange the integers so that the condition is satisfied, then divide this count by $40,320$.  

The only multiples of $3$ are $3$ and $6$, so for the condition to be satisfied, one of $3$ and $6$ needs to share a diameter with an even number.  

\subsection*{Case 1: $3$ and $6$ share a diameter}

In this case, $3$ shares a diameter with the even integer $6$, so the condition is satisfied regardless of the placement of the other integers.  

There are $4$ choices for which diameter contains $3$ and $6$, and $2$ ways to place $3$ and $6$, for a total of $8$ ways to place $3$ and $6$ on that diameter.  
There are $6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$ ways to place the remaining integers.  
Thus, there are $8 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5,760$ ways to place the integers in this case.

\subsection*{Case 2: $3$ and $6$ are on different diameters}

\textbf{Subcase 2.1: $3$ and $6$ are both on a diameter with an even number.}  
There are $8$ choices for where to place $3$, and $6$ ways to place the $6$. The remaining even integers are $2$, $4$, and $8$. There are $3$ choices for which even integer to place on the diameter with $3$, then $2$ choices for which even integer to place on the diameter with $6$.  

After these four integers are placed, there are $4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$ ways to place the remaining integers.  
Thus, there are $8 \times 6 \times 3 \times 2 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6,912$ ways to place the integers in this subcase.

\textbf{Subcase 2.2: $3$ is on a diameter with an even integer and $6$ is on a diameter with an odd integer.}  
Similar to the previous subcase, there are $8 \times 6$ ways to place $3$ and $6$. The remaining even integers are $2$, $4$, and $8$, and the remaining odd integers are $1$, $5$, and $7$. There are $3$ choices for the integer on the diameter with $3$ and $3$ choices for the integer on the diameter with $6$.  
After these integers are placed, there are $4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$ ways to place the remaining integers.  
Thus, there are $8 \times 6 \times 3 \times 3 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 10,368$ ways to place the integers in this subcase.

\textbf{Subcase 2.3: $3$ is on a diameter with an odd integer and $6$ is on a diameter with an even integer.}  
This subcase has the same count as Subcase 2.2, with $10,368$ ways.

        \item The height of \(\triangle PQS\) is the difference between the \(y\)-coordinate of \(P\) and the common \(y\)-coordinate of \(Q\) and \(S\), or \(c - 4\).
        \item The length of \(QS\) is the difference between the \(x\)-coordinates of \(Q\) and \(S\), or \(2c - c = c\).
        \item The area of \(\triangle RQS\) is 
        \[
        \frac{1}{2} \times QS \times 2 = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times 2 = c.

        \item The area of \(\triangle PQS\) is 
        \[
        \frac{1}{2} \times QS \times (c - 4) = \frac{1}{2} c (c - 4).
        \]
The area of quadrilateral \(PQRS\) is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle RQS\) and \(\triangle PQS\), which is 
    \[
    c + \frac{1}{2}c(c - 4) = c + \frac{1}{2}(c^2 - 4c) = \frac{1}{2}(c^2 - 2c) = \frac{1}{2}c(c - 2).
    \]
    \item[(e)] It is given that the area of \(PQRS\) is \(180\), so we have 
    \[
    180 = \frac{1}{2}c(c - 2),
    \]
    or 
    \[
    360 = c(c - 2).
    \]
    Since \(c\), and hence \(c - 2\), are integers, we are looking for two integers that differ by \(2\) and have a product of \(360\). Two such integers are \(c = 20\) and \(c - 2 = 18\), so the answer to the question is \(c = 20\).
To determine how \( c = 20 \) is obtained, one approach is to list the factor pairs of \( 360 \) and identify \( 18 \times 20 = 360 \). Alternatively, the equation  
\[
360 = c(c - 2)
\]  
can be solved directly by rearranging it to

c^2 - 2c - 360 = 0,

He ran $r$ km at 12 km/h, then jogged $j$ km at 8 km/h, and finally walked $w$ km at 4 km/h. Determine the number of triples $(r, j, w)$ of positive integers for which this is possible.
  ","By similar reasoning to that which was used at the beginning of the solution to part (c), Errol spent \( r \) hours running, \( j \) hours jogging, and \( w \) hours walking:
\[
\frac{r}{12} + \frac{j}{8} + \frac{w}{4} = 5.
\]
Multiplying through by 24 gives:
\[
2r + 3j + 6w = 120.
\]
We are looking for positive integer solutions to this equation. Since \( 3j \), \( 6w \), and 120 are all multiples of 3, \( 2r \) must also be a multiple of 3, which means \( r \) itself is a multiple of 3. 

Let \( r = 3k \), where \( k \) is a positive integer. Substituting \( r = 3k \) into the equation gives:
\[
6k + 3j + 6w = 120.
\]
Dividing through by 3 gives:
\[
2k + j + 2w = 40.
\]
Since \( 2k \), \( 2w \), and 40 are all even, \( j \) must also be even. Let \( j = 2m \), where \( m \) is a positive integer. Substituting \( j = 2m \) into the equation gives:
\[
2k + 2m + 2w = 40,
\]
or equivalently:
\[
k + m + w = 20.
\]
Since every value of \( k \) corresponds to exactly one value of \( r \), and every value of \( m \) corresponds to exactly one value of \( j \), we can count the triples \( (r, j, w) \) by counting the triples \( (k, m, w) \) of positive integers that satisfy \( k + m + w = 20 \).

Suppose \( k = 1 \). Then:
\[
1 + m + w = 20, \quad \text{so} \quad m + w = 19.
\]
There are 18 positive integer solutions \( (m, w) \) to this equation: \( (1, 18), (2, 17), (3, 16), \dots, (18, 1) \). Thus, there are a total of 18 solutions when \( k = 1 \).

If \( k = 2 \), then:
\[
m + w = 18.
\]
There are 17 positive integer solutions \( (m, w) \) to this equation: \( (1, 17), (2, 16), \dots, (17, 1) \). Thus, there are 17 solutions when \( k = 2 \).

Continuing in this way, there are 16 solutions when \( k = 3 \), 15 solutions when \( k = 4 \), and so on, up to there being 1 solution when \( k = 18 \).

When \( m = w = 1 \), we have:
\[
k + 1 + 1 = 20, \quad \text{so} \quad k = 18.
\]
Thus, when \( m \) and \( w \) are minimized, \( k \) is 18. Therefore, 18 is the largest that \( k \) can be.

The total number of positive integer solutions is:

        ","\section*{Solution 1}

Consider a slice of the list \(1, 2, 3, \ldots, n-1, n\). If the slice does not contain the integer \(n\), then it is also a slice of the shorter list \(1, 2, 3, \ldots, n-1\). Moreover, every slice of \(1, 2, 3, \ldots, n-1\) is a slice of \(1, 2, 3, \ldots, n-1, n\).

From the previous paragraph, we deduce that the slices of \(1, 2, 3, \ldots, n-1, n\) fall into two categories: the slices of \(1, 2, 3, \ldots, n-1\), and the slices that contain the integer \(n\). The quantity \(G_n\) can be computed as the sum of the 3-sign sums of all slices of \(1, 2, 3, \ldots, n-1\) plus the 3-sign sums of all slices that contain \(n\).

In other words, 
\[
G_n = G_{n-1} + \text{(3-sign sums of all slices of } 1, 2, 3, \ldots, n-1, n \text{ containing } n).
\]

Using this, we deduce:
\[
G_n - G_{n-1} = \text{(sum of the 3-sign sums of the slices } 1, 2, 3, \ldots, n \text{ that contain } n).
\]

For example:
\[
G_6 - G_5 = 1 + 2 - 3 + 4 + 5 - 6 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6 + 3 + 4 - 5 + 6 + 4 + 5 - 6 + 5 + 6 + 6 = 43,
\]
\[
G_5 - G_4 = 1 + 2 - 3 + 4 + 5 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 3 + 4 - 5 + 4 + 5 + 5 = 31.
\]

Observe that:
\[
G_6 - 2G_5 + G_4 = (G_6 - G_5) - (G_5 - G_4) = 43 - 31 = 12.
\]

The sums above suggest a simpler way to see that this difference equals 12 through cancellations. For instance, the first “lines” in the two sums above are almost identical except for a \(-6\). The second “lines” are identical except for a \(+6\).

To generalize, we introduce the notation \(\langle u, v \rangle\) for the 3-sign sum of the integers from \(u\) to \(v\), inclusive. For example:
\[
\langle 3, 8 \rangle = 3 + 4 - 5 + 6 + 7 - 8.
\]

Note that \(\langle u, u \rangle = u\) (the 3-sign sum of a single integer). Using this notation:
\[
G_6 - G_5 = \langle 1, 6 \rangle + \langle 2, 6 \rangle + \langle 3, 6 \rangle + \langle 4, 6 \rangle + \langle 5, 6 \rangle + \langle 6, 6 \rangle,
\]
and more generally:
\[
G_n - G_{n-1} = \langle 1, n \rangle + \langle 2, n \rangle + \langle 3, n \rangle + \cdots + \langle n-1, n \rangle + \langle n, n \rangle.
\]

Now consider the 3-sign sums \(\langle 1, n \rangle\) and \(\langle 1, n-1 \rangle\). These sums are identical except for the appearance of \(\pm n\) at the end of \(\langle 1, n \rangle\). Thus:
\[
\langle 1, n \rangle - \langle 1, n-1 \rangle = \pm n.
\]

More generally, if \(k \leq n-1\), then \(\langle k, n \rangle - \langle k, n-1 \rangle = \pm n\). The sign depends on the number of terms in \(\langle k, n \rangle\). Specifically:
\[
\langle k, n \rangle - \langle k, n-1 \rangle = 
\begin{cases} 
-n, & \text{if the number of terms is a multiple of 3}, \\
+n, & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
\]

Using this, we find:
\[
G_{3n} - 2G_{3n-1} + G_{3n-2} = (G_{3n} - G_{3n-1}) - (G_{3n-1} - G_{3n-2}),
\]
and by expanding, we derive:
\[
G_{3n} - 2G_{3n-1} + G_{3n-2} = n^2,
\]
which is a perfect square.

\section*{Solution 2}

With similar reasoning, we conclude:
\[
G_n - G_{n-1} = \langle 1, n \rangle + \langle 2, n \rangle + \cdots + \langle n, n \rangle.
\]

By analyzing the contributions of individual integers \(k\), we deduce:
\[
G_{3n} - 2G_{3n-1} + G_{3n-2} = n^2,
\]
again proving it is a perfect square.

\]
The solution that follows will compute the remainder when this sum is divided by 27 without actually computing the sum.

First, let’s focus on the sum of the first nine terms:

\[

\]
\[
- a + (a+1) + (a+2) - (a+3) + (a+4) + (a+5) - (a+6) + (a+7) + (a+8)
\]
It can be checked that this sum is equal to \( 9a + 36 \). Observe that three times this sum is
\[
3(9a + 36) = 27a + 108 = 27(a+4),
\]
which is a multiple of 27.

The 3-sign sums \( \langle 1, 2025 \rangle \), \( \langle 4, 2025 \rangle \), and \( \langle 7, 2025 \rangle \) each contain the sum:
\[
10 + 11 - 12 + 13 + 14 - 15 + 16 + 17 - 18
\]
The 3-sign sums \( \langle 2, 2025 \rangle \), \( \langle 5, 2025 \rangle \), and \( \langle 8, 2025 \rangle \) each contain the sum:

\]
The 3-sign sums \( \langle 3, 2025 \rangle \), \( \langle 6, 2025 \rangle \), and \( \langle 9, 2025 \rangle \) each contain the sum:
\[
10 - 11 + 12 + 13 - 14 + 15 + 16 - 17 + 18
\]
The three sums above can be totaled using the formula for the previous expression with \( a = 10 \). Since each sum occurs exactly three times, we conclude that in
\[
\langle 1, 2025 \rangle + \langle 2, 2025 \rangle + \langle 3, 2025 \rangle + \cdots + \langle 9, 2025 \rangle,
\]
if we look at the total of all occurrences of the integers from 10 through 18, with the appropriate signs, we will get \( 27(10 + 4) \), which is a multiple of 27.

By similar reasoning with \( a = 19 \), the sum of all occurrences of the integers 19 through 27, with the appropriate signs, is \( 27(19 + 4) \), which is a multiple of 27.

Continuing in this way, we can total all occurrences of 28 through 36 to get a multiple of 27, all occurrences of 37 through 45 to get a multiple of 27, and so on, up to all occurrences of 2017 through 2025 to get a multiple of 27. This works out neatly because \( 2025 = 9 \times 225 \) is a multiple of 9.

In conclusion, in the sum
\[
\langle 1, 2025 \rangle + \langle 2, 2025 \rangle + \langle 3, 2025 \rangle + \cdots + \langle 9, 2025 \rangle,
\]
the sum of all occurrences of the integers 10 through 2025 inclusive is the sum of multiples of 27, and so is itself a multiple of 27.

Thus,
\[
\langle 1, 2025 \rangle + \langle 2, 2025 \rangle + \langle 3, 2025 \rangle + \cdots + \langle 9, 2025 \rangle
\]
is equal to a multiple of 27 plus the following sum:
\[
1+2-3+4+5-6+7+8-9 + 2+3-4+5+6-7+8+9 + \cdots + 9,
\]
which is equal to 123 (discussed in Solution 2 to part (b)).

\section*{Problem Statement}
John takes a train that travels 80 miles per hour. His friend Mike leaves from the same location but takes a different train that goes 60 miles per hour. Mike leaves 30 minutes after John but somehow arrives 15 minutes before him. How long was John’s trip, and how far did he travel?

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{Step 1: Define Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Let \(t\) be the time (in hours) that John traveled.
    \item Since Mike arrives 15 minutes before John, his travel time is \(t - \frac{1}{4}\) hours.
    \item Mike leaves 30 minutes (or \(\frac{1}{2}\) hour) after John, so his total travel time is:
    \[
    t - \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = t - \frac{3}{4} \, \text{hours.}
    \]
    \item Let \(d\) be the distance traveled by both John and Mike.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Step 2: Set Up Equations}
We know:
\[
d = 80t \quad \text{(John's distance formula)}
\]
\[
d = 60 \left( t - \frac{3}{4} \right) \quad \text{(Mike's distance formula)}
\]

\subsection*{Step 3: Set Distances Equal}
Since both travel the same distance:
\[
80t = 60 \left( t - \frac{3}{4} \right)
\]
\[
80t = 60t - 45
\]
\[
80t - 60t = -45
\]
\[
20t = 45
\]
\[
t = \frac{45}{20} = 2.25 \, \text{hours.}
\]

\subsection*{Step 4: Calculate Distance}
Now that we know \(t = 2.25\) hours, we calculate the distance:
\[
d = 80 \times 2.25 = 180 \, \text{miles.}
\]

\subsection*{Final Answers}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{John's travel time:} \(2.25 \, \text{hours}\)
    \item \textbf{Distance traveled:} \(180 \, \text{miles}\)

Tom shoots 30\% from the 3-point line. If he takes 10 shots, he expects to make 3. However, he practices a lot and improves by 50\%. After practicing, if he takes 12 shots, how many should he expect to make?
\end{document}","\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{Step 1: Initial Success Rate}
Tom's initial shooting percentage is:

\[
\text{Initial percentage} = 30\% = 0.30.
\]

If he takes 10 shots, the expected number of successful shots is:

\[
\text{Expected makes} = 0.30 \times 10 = 3.
\]

\subsection*{Step 2: Improved Success Rate}
After practicing, Tom improves by 50\%. To calculate his new shooting percentage:

\[
\text{Improved percentage} = 0.30 + 0.50 \times 0.30.
\]

\[
\text{Improved percentage} = 0.30 + 0.15 = 0.45 \text{ or } 45\%.
\]

\subsection*{Step 3: Expected Makes After Improvement}
If Tom takes 12 shots with his improved shooting percentage, the expected number of makes is:

\[
\text{Expected makes after practice} = 0.45 \times 12 = 5.4.
\]

\section*{Final Answer}
Tom should expect to make approximately \textbf{5 or 6 shots} after practicing.

\maketitle

\section*{Problem Statement}
A car accelerates from 0 to 60 mph in 5 seconds. Calculate its acceleration in m/s². If it maintains this acceleration, how fast will it be going in 10 seconds?

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{Step 1: Convert mph to m/s}
We know:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Initial speed, \(v_i = 0 \, \text{mph}\)
    \item Final speed, \(v_f = 60 \, \text{mph}\)
\end{itemize}

To convert 60 mph to meters per second:

\[
1 \text{ mile} = 1609.34 \text{ meters, and } 1 \text{ hour} = 3600 \text{ seconds.}
\]

\[
v_f = 60 \times \frac{1609.34}{3600} \approx 26.82 \, \text{m/s.}
\]

\subsection*{Step 2: Calculate acceleration}
The formula for acceleration is:

\[
a = \frac{v_f - v_i}{t}.
\]

\[
a = \frac{26.82 - 0}{5} = 5.36 \, \text{m/s².}
\]

\subsection*{Step 3: Speed after 10 seconds}
To calculate the speed after 10 seconds if the acceleration remains constant:

\[
v = v_i + at.
\]

\[
v = 0 + 5.36 \times 10 = 53.6 \, \text{m/s.}
\]

\subsection*{Final Answers}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Acceleration:} \(5.36 \, \text{m/s²}\)
    \item \textbf{Speed after 10 seconds:} \(53.6 \, \text{m/s}\), which is approximately \(120 \, \text{mph.}\)
