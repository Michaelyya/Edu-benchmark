\maketitle

\section*{Problem Statement}
John takes a train that travels 80 miles per hour. His friend Mike leaves from the same location but takes a different train that goes 60 miles per hour. Mike leaves 30 minutes after John but somehow arrives 15 minutes before him. How long was John’s trip, and how far did he travel?

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{Step 1: Define Variables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Let \(t\) be the time (in hours) that John traveled.
    \item Since Mike arrives 15 minutes before John, his travel time is \(t - \frac{1}{4}\) hours.
    \item Mike leaves 30 minutes (or \(\frac{1}{2}\) hour) after John, so his total travel time is:
    \[
    t - \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = t - \frac{3}{4} \, \text{hours.}
    \]
    \item Let \(d\) be the distance traveled by both John and Mike.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Step 2: Set Up Equations}
We know:
\[
d = 80t \quad \text{(John's distance formula)}
\]
\[
d = 60 \left( t - \frac{3}{4} \right) \quad \text{(Mike's distance formula)}
\]

\subsection*{Step 3: Set Distances Equal}
Since both travel the same distance:
\[
80t = 60 \left( t - \frac{3}{4} \right)
\]
\[
80t = 60t - 45
\]
\[
80t - 60t = -45
\]
\[
20t = 45
\]
\[
t = \frac{45}{20} = 2.25 \, \text{hours.}
\]

\subsection*{Step 4: Calculate Distance}
Now that we know \(t = 2.25\) hours, we calculate the distance:
\[
d = 80 \times 2.25 = 180 \, \text{miles.}
\]

\subsection*{Final Answers}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{John's travel time:} \(2.25 \, \text{hours}\)
    \item \textbf{Distance traveled:} \(180 \, \text{miles}\)
\end{itemize}

Tom shoots 30\% from the 3-point line. If he takes 10 shots, he expects to make 3. However, he practices a lot and improves by 50\%. After practicing, if he takes 12 shots, how many should he expect to make?
\end{document}","\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{Step 1: Initial Success Rate}
Tom's initial shooting percentage is:

\[
\text{Initial percentage} = 30\% = 0.30.
\]

If he takes 10 shots, the expected number of successful shots is:

\[
\text{Expected makes} = 0.30 \times 10 = 3.
\]

\subsection*{Step 2: Improved Success Rate}
After practicing, Tom improves by 50\%. To calculate his new shooting percentage:

\[
\text{Improved percentage} = 0.30 + 0.50 \times 0.30.
\]

\[
\text{Improved percentage} = 0.30 + 0.15 = 0.45 \text{ or } 45\%.
\]

\subsection*{Step 3: Expected Makes After Improvement}
If Tom takes 12 shots with his improved shooting percentage, the expected number of makes is:

\[
\text{Expected makes after practice} = 0.45 \times 12 = 5.4.
\]

\section*{Final Answer}
Tom should expect to make approximately \textbf{5 or 6 shots} after practicing.

\title{Car Acceleration Problem}
\author{}
\date{}
\maketitle

\section*{Problem Statement}
A car accelerates from 0 to 60 mph in 5 seconds. Calculate its acceleration in m/s². If it maintains this acceleration, how fast will it be going in 10 seconds?

\section*{Solution}

\subsection*{Step 1: Convert mph to m/s}
We know:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Initial speed, \(v_i = 0 \, \text{mph}\)
    \item Final speed, \(v_f = 60 \, \text{mph}\)
\end{itemize}

To convert 60 mph to meters per second:

\[
1 \text{ mile} = 1609.34 \text{ meters, and } 1 \text{ hour} = 3600 \text{ seconds.}
\]

\[
v_f = 60 \times \frac{1609.34}{3600} \approx 26.82 \, \text{m/s.}
\]

\subsection*{Step 2: Calculate acceleration}
The formula for acceleration is:

\[
a = \frac{v_f - v_i}{t}.
\]

\[
a = \frac{26.82 - 0}{5} = 5.36 \, \text{m/s².}
\]

\subsection*{Step 3: Speed after 10 seconds}
To calculate the speed after 10 seconds if the acceleration remains constant:

\[
v = v_i + at.
\]

\[
v = 0 + 5.36 \times 10 = 53.6 \, \text{m/s.}
\]

\subsection*{Final Answers}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Acceleration:} \(5.36 \, \text{m/s²}\)
    \item \textbf{Speed after 10 seconds:} \(53.6 \, \text{m/s}\), which is approximately \(120 \, \text{mph.}\)
